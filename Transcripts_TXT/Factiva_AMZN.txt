OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2016 financial results teleconference.

   TD
(Operator Instructions)

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.

DARIN MANNEY, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial result as well as metric and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.

Our comments and responses to your questions reflect Management's view as of today, October 27th, 2016, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial result is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filing.

During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In the press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world event, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investment restructurings or legal settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please state your question.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking the question. The international retail segment margin was the lowest we have seen in quite a while. I was hoping that you could provide some of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 4Q guide. Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Sure. Thanks, Doug. Specifically to international, we are seeing expansion to support selection expansion fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional prime benefits, Fresh location and Prime Now. By far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make. Very excited about the initial reaction in India from both customers and also sellers. That is essentially the international margin guidance in Q4.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: Great. Thanks. I guess when we think about the progression in margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat lining of overall margin at this point, excluding AWS, should we think about this as a temporary plateau that will at some point will resume once you start leveraging your fulfillment build-out or is there something structural that is philosophically changing with the way that you operate your business. Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes. Thanks, Gene. We will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. The things that I'm about to mention fall into that category. The largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between the first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year are the things that I mentioned on the call last quarter.

First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year over year in the second half of the year. It continues to be a large increase for both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers and we have added 5 more in October. For the year, we will add 26. Most of those are in North America.

That compares to 14 last year and I would -- looking back, there is -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter. There was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4. It is helping us position better for Q4 volumes, because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we ship, includes FBA is significantly higher than even that. We are continuing to build for high AFN, or Amazon fulfilled network demand, including both retail and FBA.

The number of warehouses that we added represent the 30% increase in square footage year over year. Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses, plus our sortation and delivery centers, so it's pretty much our end-customer service centers. It's pretty much our square footage that support operations.

Those will dissipate as we -- as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers initial startup costs include increase in fixed cost but also variable cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory. There's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. They are inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. There will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017.

What you are seeing, essentially, in the second half of this year is a step-up investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service rapid growth in that business.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, just to go back, Brian, to the fulfillment build. In the past you talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies. With these new FCs opening, can you talk about if you become more efficient, so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk of deleverage or should we still think about it's going to take time to get up to peak efficiency?

The second one at AWS, Amazon the Company is good in removing friction in the purchase process. Can you talk about some of the main hurdles you have to overcome for large enterprises to start using AWS more? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. In the fulfillment network, as we build it yes, they will be more productive next year than this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018. I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs in Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we built the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program.

The FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. That's a self-reinforcing loop where Prime -- the Prime success attracts more sellers. We're glad to have that problem. We are just working very hard to get capacity in place and productive use for Q4 and beyond.

DARIN MANNEY: Hi, Brian. This is Darin. On the AWS question, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers. In addition to the technologies that make integrations easier and it helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS if we're going to continue to do that. Specifically, the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime.

Also, many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS schema conversion tool which really switches database engines to get out of old-guard proprietary databases and on to AWS. We will continue to react to customer needs and that will include opening up new regions. We have opened up Ohio this past quarter. We've highlighted that we will have a number of regions coming online in a few months. Yes, we're doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Okay. Hey, Brian, would you give us any commentary on two categories in particular, groceries and fashion and apparel? Particularly on groceries, I know in the release there was a couple of data points about Fresh rolling out into newer areas like Maryland. Great to see that. Can you just talk about that in the investment horizon? Is that moving the needle for you and how big that -- any way to help us quantify how big that already is to your -- to the revenue growth that you're seeing, particularly on groceries and any particular comment on fashion and apparel. Same line of thinking. Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Thanks, Mark. I will start with Fresh and groceries in general. Yes, this quarter we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago. We also launched a new pricing plan, which is a monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the US. We have expanded, as you know, previously into London.

We're very happy with the progression both in the geographies that we have been in for a long time where we are at, continuing to add zip codes and additional neighborhoods and also in these new cities. Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability. We are finding at the very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after.

Similarly, but not exactly the same, is the Prime Now business which has similar overlap on things besides groceries. It is a slightly different model, obviously, where we're more about immediacy and smaller list items available in one to two hours. There's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. That is now up to 40 cities across 7 countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding Amazon Restaurant Delivery to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the US. That is up from two last year.

We continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers. We are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. We're very happy with the Amazon Fresh and we have now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year. Prime Now we're also very happy with, although obviously the economics in that business are even tougher, but we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of our geographic footprint and how close we already are to customers.

DARIN MANNEY: Hi, Mark, this is Darin. On fashion, fashion and apparel continue to be a large part of our EGM business and one that we're very excited about. We continue to make it easier for brands and manufacturers to come on board in that category. We continue to work with brands to come on board. We're happy with the traction that we're seeing with those brands. As we get more and more selection, we're really pleased with the customer engagement that we have there, both from the discoverability, the technology that goes behind making it easier to shop fashion on our site, as well as the (inaudible) selection by adding the brand.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sorry. To answer your question about whether that is part of investment. Yes, it certainly is part of our investment. The larger ramp, if you will, in investment that we're seeing from the back end of last year and also the first half of this year is more related to digital content and the building our fulfillment network, which I already discussed.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thanks a lot. In some of these incremental investment areas like warehouses, logistics and also content, I know in some cases you expense up front. In some cases you amortized over time. Wondering if you can give us a sense of how much of the recent step-up is being expensed. I'm particularly looking at your COGS as a percent of retail revenues that was up year over year for the first time in quite a while. How much of that was because of content that expensed in the period? Just trying to better understand that.

I think also you have been changing around, and this is happening here shortly, FBA pricing, including increasing your storage fees but also reducing your handling fees. I guess the question is, are these changes designed to just pass through kind of increasing shipping costs or is this more of a net neutral change where really the goal is to try to free up capacity in some of your facilities? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Let me start with your second question on FBA. Yes, we did make some changes to the pricing formula for this holiday season. They're essentially meant to incent the right behavior among sellers around holiday. The biggest issue you're trying to get at is having the most valuable products for holiday in the warehouse, in the Prime space and not having the warehouse filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year. We are trying to incentivize that behavior. We're also trying to incentivize getting inventory into the warehouse quicker. Yes, the formulas were -- the changes to the pricing formulas were really with that in mind, to help the flow and the space utilization in Q4.

DARIN MANNEY: Yes. Hi, Mark. This is Darin. On the capitalization point, I'd say the things that get capitalized are the core buildings and the leasehold improvements in the buildings. The things that we're seeing hit the P&L are the fixed and variable expenses that it takes to run the building. I think that is what Brian is pointing out most pointedly in terms of what is impacting our profitability of second half. Yes, the capitalization is relatively small in terms of -- other than the building itself.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Yes. Two quick questions. With the step-up in investments and content from Prime Video as you mentioned before, you would also be stepping up the international expansion? Maybe you can just remind us how many countries you're in with Prime Video and whether there is a potential chance of stripping Prime Video from Prime to allow it to be extended to other countries. Do you -- I know you're not guiding to 2017, but just looking at the capacity increase that you had for FCs for 2016, should we expect that kind of as an ongoing expense going forward or is the current build-up enough to give you spare capacity to cool that down for 2017? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. First on your video comment, we're in four countries right now, the US, UK, Germany and Japan and we have stated that we will be in India soon. The content that we are creating, through Amazon studios, we are generally holding the worldwide rights to and can use that in other countries as well. The cost of that then get amortized to the country and becomes part of the international segment results. Yes, we consider that to be very valuable as opposed to versus licensing many times, by country the third-party rights to content that we don't create ourselves.

Your question on fulfillment expenses, I can't extend the guidance into next year. We will do that, obviously, at the end of next quarter. I would say we are -- this was in extraordinary step-up as I mentioned in Q3 that is tied to very rapid growth in not only paid units but Amazon fulfilled units. Really our forecast for additional capacity additions and the rate of addition will be tied to those growth factors as well.

We will have to see. We right now are working on getting the capacity in. It was very lumpy this time, with 18 warehouses in one quarter and another 5 in the first three weeks of the next quarter. Obviously we will be working on the efficiencies of all of the warehouse we have, including the ones that we just started up this year.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, BAIRD EQUITY RESEARCH: Thanks. A follow-up on the FC question. I guess more specifically, it sounds like you have enough capacity in terms of fulfillment centers for the holidays. Also wondering what your comfort level is in terms of your shipping partners to manage those deliveries. Secondly, was wondering how you would characterize the pricing environment for AWS, in particular with more deep pocketed competitors in the space now. Google in fact highlighted this on their conference call today. Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Let me start with transportation. Yes, we are looking forward to a great holiday. That includes working with our shipping partners, both in the US and globally. We have worked very closely with them to line up capacity, share capacity plans. We certainly have additional delivery capability of our own, but with all of our partners, we work well in advance of the holiday to get our plans in place. We feel very confident we're looking forward to a great holiday not only for customers but also for sellers.

On your question on AWS, I didn't listen to the Google call. You will have to fill me in on that later. The thing that I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is -- price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3. That was our 52nd since we started this business. It's -- we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only did we lower the prices of our products but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. They can also benefit from that as well.

If you step back and say, why do people choose AWS? I'll give you the points I said last quarter. Basically what we hear are the functionality and pace of innovation. It is greater than our competition. We have added new -- more new significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've read about the VMware deal that we signed this quarter. We continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better can support customers.

Finally, experience. We have been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else. We've used that time to make our product and services better. There's going to be a lot of winners in the space, as we said, but we are very happy with our position and the customer reception to our products.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Great. Thank you. I guess when you look at fourth-quarter guidance and you back out AWS, it suggests that margins are -- on the core business are going to be pretty down versus last year. Do you view this as an abnormal investment cycle or just part of the overall kind of ebbs and flows of the business? Long term, I know several years ago you talked about maybe high-single-digit, low-double-digit margins long term. I wonder if you could refresh us on that and also let us know if you think international has structural marginal differences than the US, the core retail business.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Yes. As far as the continuation of the investment and into next year, I cannot give you as much color on that today. What I can tell you again is that we have ramped up considerably. We have been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year, particularly tied again to the fulfillment center and expanded also the video content spend.

We will continue to invest in video content. We will continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes than shipped unit volumes. We will continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. Devices we will invest in, particularly Alexa and the Echo products. We will continue to invest in getting faster and faster shipping methods for our consumers. We believe that is working. We are very happy with the results. We're very happy with all of the customers we have but particularly the Prime customers that we have.

As far as long-term operating margins, I can't forecast that right now. I can't forecast that for our AWS business, either. We are, again, working on two fronts. We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient, as profitable as possible while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line.

We have said we want things that customers will love, can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and durable and can last for decades. That is still our mission. We have pillars of the business right now with Marketplace, AWS and Prime and we're actively looking for a fourth and fifth pillar.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great. I'm wondering, there obviously have been some headlines since the call that you did earlier with the press on the scale of this investment cycle relative to other investment cycles that you have been through. With the 2014 cycle sort of being the most recent, could you quantify a little bit more how you would compare this investment cycle to that most recent one? To the extent that we're in the midst of this investment cycle, would you say we're in sort of the earlier or later stages? Any sort of clarity around that would be useful. Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Yes. The word cycle, if I mentioned that, was an omission. It was a misspeak. The investment that we are seeing is a step-up versus what we have experienced in particularly the first half of this year and the last half, the second half of last year, which I mentioned.

We have said investments are going to be lumpy. They are going to be high sometimes and they will be moderate at other times. We are right now, the second half of this year looks like a big step-up compared to the first half, and it is. But, again, it is all areas that we will continue to investment in, some of which I just actually went through the laundry list.

I would not characterize it as the cycle. I would characterize it as continued investments. We make investments with the idea that they are going to pay off and they pay off in either directly in the business they're in or in their contribution to the total business, many times as a part of the Prime program.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great. Thanks. Two questions. It seems that you're increasing your efforts in the auto vertical with the recent launch of Amazon Vehicles. Just wondering if you can discuss some of the dynamics of the auto industry that make it attractive and maybe how it aligns with the Prime value prop. Also wondering if you had any plans to work directly with auto shops, just given your ability to service most areas in one to two days.

The second question, on grocery, would you consider physical locations in an effort to kind of expand and/or accelerate growth in that vertical? Thank you.

DARIN MANNEY: Hi, John. This is Darin. On vehicle, Amazon Vehicles is really a car research destination and built the automotive community for customers. Gets information that they need when shopping for vehicles offsite or shopping for parts and accessories on-site. The features include research tools, community engagement, where you can talk to other customers. Certainly we try to build a one-stop shop for vehicles as an extension to the automotive store, which engages customers to add information about their cars in the garage which makes it actually easier to shop for parts and accessories for your particular vehicle.

We think there's a lot of opportunity there to add convenience for customers. On the b2b side, certainly we do have an Amazon business offering. Businesses of all shapes and sizes can sign up to be a b2b customer. The selection that we have in our parts and automotive categories are certainly open to that channel. I wouldn't speculate on anything that we might do in a particular vertical for those business customers.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Your comment on -- your question on grocery and physical stores, I can't comment on any rumors or speculations there might be regarding that. What I will tell you is that we have experimented with physical stores. As you may know, we have three physical bookstores, one in Seattle, one in San Diego and one in Portland and two more coming, one in Boston and one in Chicago.

What we're finding is they're great places for customers to browse what ends up being a curated selection of books and they also get to try out our devices, which is very beneficial. They get to touch and try our e-readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo. We like what we see with that connection. We also have pop-up stores that you may see and also college pick-up points. We will try different delivery methods or pick-up points or ways of getting product to customers, but nothing specific to point out on the grocery side right now.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Given the low unemployment rates that you are seeing in the US, do you expect any unusual impact on wages for seasonal workers this year? Are you seeing overall wage pressure in the fulfillment centers? Separately, if you could talk about trend lines you are seeing in paid units versus shipping units. Are they diverging meaningfully versus the past? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes. On wages, nothing to point out for this holiday. Our challenge generally is the volume of head count that we're looking to hire. We work well in advance with agencies to help to get seasonal employees and many of them turn into full-time employees after the holiday. Nothing specific on the wage pressure front. As you probably saw, head count is up 38% year over year in Q3 and that is continuation of a lot of ops roles that are supporting this high demand, the opening the fulfillment centers we talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now, but also and a lot of hiring in our tech areas, strictly around AWS and also the Echo/Alexa areas.

OPERATOR: Thank you.

DARIN MANNEY: I'm sorry. The second question?

OPERATOR: Sorry, go ahead. Okay. Our final question will come from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.

NEIL DOSHI, ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES: Thanks. Can you provide a little more color into the investments that you're making in India? What is driving that growth and what stage is India in today relative to some of the other large international markets that you have launched in the past?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, sure. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing in India, but it is certainly very early on still. Most recent highlights would be the launch of the Prime program in India this past quarter. It's now one of the top-selling units on Amazon.India. It has been well received by customers.

It is hard to compare India to any other country. It is very different in its stage and structure. Being a third-party market has caused a lot of invention on our side. We're being creative. The team there in India has been very creative on whenever they find a roadblock or something that has not existed in another country, they create it themselves, whether that's from delivery stations to working with small merchants to you name it. We're very happy with both the customer engagement that we're seeing and also the seller engagement, which is very important in India. Very pleased with the team that brought that over there and the way they work with teams throughout the world.

DARIN MANNEY: Brian, to step back to Ben's other question on units. Ben, this is Darin. Paid units grew at 28% again this year, as it did in the prior quarter. As Brian pointed out earlier, our AFN units, our Amazon Fulfilled Units, which includes our first-party units as well as FBA unit that's that go through our warehouses, are continuing -- are certainly higher than that 28%. That is a result of the traction we're getting with our FBA sellers.

Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2016 financial results teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.

   TD
DARIN MANNEY, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q2 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and the responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today July 28, 2016, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on form 10K and subsequent filings.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Now I will turn the call over to Brian.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Darin. I'll begin with comments on our second-quarter financial results.

Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow, less lease principal repayments, increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow, less financed lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases, increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million.

Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion or 30% excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units.

Now I will talk about our segment results. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin, compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.

International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. International operating loss was $135 million, compared with a loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.

Amazon Web Services revenue grew 58% to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin, compared with $305 million in the prior year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion, or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year over year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared with the net income of $92 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion, or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million, compared with $406 million in third quarter 2015.

We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that I will hand it back to Darin.

Thank you, Brian. Before we move to questions I need to remind you that our guidance incorporates the order trend that we've seen to date, and what we believe to be appropriate assumptions.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.

Our guidance also assumes that we do not conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

With that let's move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.

(Operation Instructions)

Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there that suggest that you're accelerating your build-out of fulfillment capacity in North America and obviously also in India. Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid-term on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI? Especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Yes, let me talk a little bit about guidance, and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike.

In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3, and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis. So, why are we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. Customers are well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight on capacity.

This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are - Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by - units fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth. So we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year.

So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 - excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the US and internationally, and we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows - TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments, certainly, that are increasing sequentially. I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend.

DARIN MANNEY: And, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.

MARK MAY: And, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend to with the doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: We're not disclosing that at this time.

MARK MAY: Thanks.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please state your question.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a minute. I didn't hear any commentary around new Prime members in particular. Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you could provide a little bit more color around that.

And then also, is there anything else that stood out in terms of what you learned around operations and systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter and if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that a fair assumption for what you're thinking about? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015. It was a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales. And more importantly, it was a great day for customers. Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015.

So we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time.

DARIN MANNEY: And on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based compensation and other operating expense to our North America, international and AWS segments. So we're including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately guided to stock-based comp and other income expense this quarter.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: Hello, good afternoon. First, love the conference call format here. Get right to it. In terms of questions, the customer count, can you give us a little bit of guidance on that? And then also talk about the theme of automated consumption and separately, the importance of Prime Now and how you can grow those SKUs. Thanks.

DARIN MANNEY: Hi, Gene. This is Darin. I'll start with the customer accounts. As we noted again in our Q1 release, our active customer accounts exceeded 300 million. However, today we're not going to update that number.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: To your question on Prime Now, so I will point out Prime Now is now in more than 40 metro areas worldwide. In the past quarter we expanded further internationally to Germany, Spain and France, so it's a global program, again, offering free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items. We also have in the same vein of, I think what you called maybe automated consumption, the same day has expanded. Now we've added 11 metro areas, bringing the total to 27 metro areas that are qualified for same day.

So, yes, we think this is an important part of our Prime offering. We know customers love it. We're very happy with their order patterns from Prime Now, and very happy with it. Of course, we do always talk about - we always usually get asked about profitability, and it is a very hard service to deliver and make money on. But we know customers love it and we're in a great position to do this because of our long-term approach, our drive of greater efficiencies and our proximity to the customer with our vast global FC network.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great, thanks. I was wondering as it relates to the Q3 guidance, can you give us a bit of a sense of just how we should think about margins in the AWS business, especially as the next eight availability zones roll out? Presumably that kind of increase in capacity likely has an impact on margins, but would appreciate any direction you can share on how to think about that.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. We don't give - obviously we don't give segment-based guidance. But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next - in the coming year. The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see a large step-up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself.

We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more of their workloads on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps. And we also open up to new customers when we add these regions. So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, BERNSTEIN: Thank you. Two questions if I may. As I look at your tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year-on-year decline for the last two quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid-2010, and of course it's reflected in the AWS margins. Can you help us understand what has driven this significant change in relative trajectory in tech and content expenses? And the second question is, why is it that the rate at which you are deploying Prime Now is so much greater or faster than the rate at which you are deploying Fresh? What's different between them and how is it that you are deploying Fresh in new markets but not as fast as Prime Now, and what drives the difference? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. On tech and content, that's going to be a combination of our people cost related to many areas of the website and also the infrastructure cost to run it, at both the Amazon Web Services and also the Amazon site. We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on not only better efficiency, but also driving cost out of our acquisition prices. So, there's a lot of great work going on there and I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we're happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins.

On Prime Now versus Fresh, they are separate - sorry. The - we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as two new sites in London for AmazonFresh, and that was the first international location. But we've been running AmazonFresh for seven years, or excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle. And what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America and more so we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding zip codes, adding additional customers. So, the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points and as - it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering.

Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. The - it has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of one-hour and two-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people need in a short period of time. So, they have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them.

OPERATOR: Our next question is from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the Echo. Anything you could share at all on some of the most commonly used searches? How are consumers using the Echo as of now most commonly, and then anything on uplift in purchase behavior from Echo households? And the second one on Prime, on AWS margins, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes that have been driving the AWS margin expansion we've seen in the first half of this year? Is it utilization, product mixes? What's been driving the margin expansion? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices, launching the Dot and Tap and Fire TV skills this past year. And now we have 1,900 third-party skills for the Alexa, including new skills from Kayak, Lyft, NBC, Honeywell and more. So there's a lot of uses that we're seeing for Echo. A lot ties into our Prime Music offering. It's just a great way to access Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. We don't have anything to disclose on physical orders from - through - excuse me, orders through Echo.

On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this is primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. There is a - certainly a mix of products and services. I don't have a bridge for you on whether that's helpful or hurtful, but the - these margins in AWS will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and that's what you're seeing. But we're very happy with the year-over-year improvement.

OPERATOR: Next question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Okay. Brian, could you give us some whys as to the revenue growth acceleration that you're seeing, a little more color about the revenue growth acceleration in North American retail and in international retail? I remember last quarter you called out really starting to see, I don't know, critical mass, tipping point, whatever the buzzword is, from Prime and from FBA in international markets. Is that what's continuing, I assume, to drive that re-acceleration in any geographic country comments behind that? Thanks a lot.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Yes, I have the same buzzwords for you, Mark. It's really -- the flywheel of Prime is definitely working. It's as simple as that. The low prices, vast selection and convenience continue to resonate with customers. Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable. So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits. We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa.

FBA is bringing more Prime-eligible selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great traction for other FBA sellers. So that is essentially what we're seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to those offers globally.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Thank you. Two questions, please. Brian, your operating income has been come in stronger than expectations, but more importantly, stronger than your own guidance, at least in the last couple of quarters. I was just wondering as you look back at where you guided relative to actual, where do you think that delta was most pronounced? Why wouldn't we assume that maybe, at least on the margin, the investment intensity in the business has maybe decelerated a bit?

And second, on Prime Video, just was wondering, considering what the main competitor there is doing, i.e., expanding aggressively around the world, you guys have been growing in a more measured manner, is that still the plan or are you guys interested in maybe instead of moving into a few countries, expand globally in one fell swoop? That's it. Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Let me start with the second question first. So on Prime Video, again, we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know the customers love it. We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in the second half of the year versus last year's second half, and we're tripling the Amazon Originals content.

That Originals content for TV and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon Originals. So, stay tuned for that. I don't have any more to announce on that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came in the very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high volume as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance.

But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about level of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on behalf of customers. But we also work very hard at efficiencies and scaling the businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right - in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers, and also driving efficiencies. And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Mr. Helfstein, your line is live.

RAY MCDONOUGH, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER & CO.: Hi. Sorry about that. This is Ray McDonough on for Jason Helfstein. Just on the AWS side, we've been hearing a lot of talk and especially a lot of media reports that larger customers tend to use AWS, they might use Google and Microsoft Azure in tandem in a multi-cloud kind of architecture. Just wondering your thoughts on how you see AWS fitting in the overall ecosystem and kind of your place longer term in the ecosystem.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Well, first of all, we believe customers will choose AWS primarily for three factors, the functionality and pace of innovation that we bring to the table, our partner and customer ecosystem and our experience. We've been in this business longer than anyone. Having said that, there's plenty of room for multiple winners in this business. What we focus on is innovating on behalf of customers and expanding the geographic footprint to make our services more widely available.

You can see us continue to invest in things like new application services, higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and then continuing to add functionality for data analytics, mobile, Internet of things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and greater value for AWS customers. And I would say the rapid pace of innovation continues to stretch our lead in that dimension. We have had 422 new significant services and features added in the first half of this year. That's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and features. So we feel good about the business position we're in and our position with customers.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: Okay. Thanks, guys. As another follow up on the margins, I was hoping you could comment on any impact from the investments and build out of enhanced transportation capabilities including the air cargo leases. And then secondly, was hoping you could identify any categories within EGM that are becoming more meaningful drivers of growth or at least are an increasing focus on the retail side? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, sure. First, on EGM, I'll just say the growth is across a lot of different products, none to exactly call out here, and we think that a lot of it is, of course, driven by the growth of Prime itself. EGM in North America grew 32%, which was higher than the revenue growth rate, and also grew 36% internationally. So when people join Prime, they are certainly buying EGM in strong quantity. So that continues to grow with the growth of the Prime program.

On transportation, I think your question was about whether that's impacting our short-term results. No, the answer is no. We are certainly expanding our service offerings in the transportation side and we have been for many years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods. The plane deal that we were talking about is essentially planes that we're going to be leasing from other companies, and you'll hear more about that as we go forward, but that is to essentially take on the demand for internal flights as we move product around. It certainly will be well utilized.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Brian Pitz from Jefferies.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC: Thanks for the questions. First, on FC build out, is the cost of building centers scaling over time given the use of Kiva, other technologies or general learnings, or are those costs still relatively consistent? And also, we noticed some device sellout in the next four to five weeks, post-Prime Day. Was this a bit of a planned inventory reduction for some of the devices or did volumes take you by surprise here?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: I will start with the second question. So I would just say Prime Day had enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and also well adopted by customers. So it was the largest device sales day that we've ever had and essentially pretty much across all of our device types, E-readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo.

And I'm sorry, your first question was around - the cost of fulfillment centers. Not disclosing that we do continue to change our fulfillment centers. We've changed, again, the automation, the size, the scale many times and we continue to learn and grow there. So no general trends I can point to on cost per fulfillment center to start up, but because they do vary in size and mission and some have fully outfitted in using Amazon Robotics, others - some don't for economic reasons. Maybe the volume is not perfect for robot volume. But, yes, so I can't give you any real distinct trends there.

OPERATOR: Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Great. Thank you. First on the customers, I'm guessing - I'm wondering why you aren't giving the number, a lot of people use it for their models. And then second thing, when you look at the US Prime penetration versus total US customers, how do you feel about that and do you think there's still a lot of room for Prime growth in the US? Thank you.

DARIN MANNEY: Hi, Justin. This is Darin. I'll comment on the customer accounts again. We may consider updating that in the future, but really we encourage you and our investors to look at our free cash flow measures, our revenue and our GAAP operating profit since our customer purchasing behavior can vary.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: And on Prime penetration, of course, we haven't released Prime subscription levels. We have talked about growth certainly globally and in North America. What I can tell you there is we still think there's a lot of room in Prime. We've tailored programs to students, we've tailored video programs, we've rolled out monthly plans, we have plans with grocery delivery.

So there's a lot of different flavors of Prime and we are aggressively looking for a perfect Prime for everybody. We know that, again, when customers try Prime, they like it. So it's really just about getting them to try Prime and continuing to deliver great Prime benefits and great low prices and selection.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks, guys. I just had two. First as a follow up on the logistics topic. So, in addition to the cargo planes you just mentioned for in-network moving products around, you guys have registered and received a US maritime license to operate as a freight forwarder and you recently announced this partnership with the UK for drone delivery that you've been working for a couple years. At a high level, can you just talk about how the overall logistics strategy is evolving from trucks and fulfillment centers to incorporate some of these new methods and how that might impact your unit costs going forward?

And then the second question's on AWS. So you continue to put up really strong results, and you guys obviously talk to a lot of customers across lots of different verticals. Just a high level, what percent of enterprise workloads do you think have shifted to the public cloud at this stage? Is it low-single digit to mid-single-digit? And any color there on where we are in terms of penetration in the space. Thank you.

DARIN MANNEY: So thank you, Ross. This is Darin. Let me take that first question. On Prime Air in the UK, we've been working with and developing Prime Air for some time to develop a rapid delivery system that is safe, environmentally sound and it really enhances the services that we provide for millions of customers. And we're extremely happy to partner with the UK government to advance the safe use of drones for small parcel delivery. This is providing us with permission to trial new methods in the space, including beyond line-of-sight operation, sense-and-avoid technologies and flights where one person operates multiple drones.

So we definitely appreciate the pragmatic and forward-looking approach on this topic with the UK, and we're going to continue to work with regulators and policymakers in many countries, including the US, so we're excited about there. As for the ocean-going licenses, we have no comment on that today.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: As far as AWS, essentially penetration question you asked. We think still very early. Again, we like our position, our industry leading position in the cloud space, and we're working on things that would incent more and more customers to accelerate their cloud conversion. The lower prices and services that we offer, and as I said, we'll work on things that will make it easier and easier for customers to work with us with their hybrid data centers or transfer their volume to us.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.

ERIC SHERIDAN, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one clarification and one big picture topic. On the clarification, appreciate the disclosure on content and how that'll double year-on-year in the second half. For purposes of just making sure we can understand the trajectory, is there any way to frame it within second half of this year versus first half of this year, just so we can try to triangulate on a gross margin basis from the content spend? And the bigger picture topic would be China, hasn't come up yet on the call. I wanted to understand your latest thoughts there on either the competitive landscape, relative positioning in China and how you think about investments in China. Thank you.

DARIN MANNEY: So, hi, Eric. This is Darin. I'll take the second question on China. So we continue to operate well in China. We see China as a - and the way we're approaching China as a way to - a trusted avenue for our Chinese customers to access authentic international brands and we'll focus on those global brands and bringing those to Chinese customers. Offerings like the Amazon Global Store where Chinese customers can access those international brands on the China website and have them shipped directly to their houses is something we're focused on. So, yes, it's still early days and some of those experiments that we're doing, but we're seeing good traction on those things and we like that.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, and on the content spend, I think the only other data point I can give you is probably a dated one at this point, but we spent $1.3 billion in 2014, that's the last number that we disclosed and we continue to add content. The best I can give you at this point is that it will be double, nearly double what we spent in the second half of 2015.

OPERATOR: Our final question will come from Victor Anthony from Axiom.

VICTOR ANTHONY, ANALYST, AXIOM CAPITAL: Thanks for putting me on. Maybe I'll just ask a question about India. You called out India was - you had the most visited e-commerce site as well as the most downloaded mobile app, and you also launched Prime. So maybe you could just talk about the opportunities and the challenges that you see in that market. And second, there was some press reports that you invested about $500 million of incremental capital in Italy. I was wondering, what are you seeing in that market that justifies that level of investment?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. So India, we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far in India, both with customers and also sellers; that's a third-party seller market. You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will be a whole new experience for Indian customers. In hundreds of cities we'll now have unlimited free one-day and two-day delivery, and we also mentioned that Prime Video is coming there, both Indian and global content.

We're also starting to see exclusive online sales partnerships. Recently, we've had partnerships with Motorola, Samsung, Lenovo on select phones. But more importantly, again, we really like the opportunity in India. We like the initial results that we see from customers and also sellers. We really like our team there. We have a great team of Amazonians who've been very inventive in India.

Every time there's an obstacle or something that's different from the US or another major business, they'll invent around it, whether it's a shipping method or a payment method or whatever. So, very creative and the customer response has been really strong. So we are very excited about the Prime program. We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've seen great success in every country in the world that we've launched Prime, and we feel India is going to be no different. So we're looking forward to seeing what we can do on behalf of the Indian customer.

DARIN MANNEY: And hi, Victor, this is Darin. On Italy, yes, we continue to invest in Italy and really throughout Europe to keep pace with the strong customer demand we see. Since opening Italy in 2010, we've invested over EUR450 million and created 1,700 jobs in Italy, and this increased investment will be to add future FC near Rome and other infrastructure assets. So, yes, this is really to support both the customers that we have there in Italy and throughout Europe, and we'll continue to invest in the coming years.

So thank you for joining the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2016 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.

   TD
PHIL HARDIN, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2016 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, April 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.5 billion up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less financed lease principal repayments and assets required under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion.

Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance and lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion, or 29% excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had pre-orders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded 285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units.

Now, I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined and titled stock-based compensation and other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income including stock-based compensation and other was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America's segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year.

In the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion, or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion, or 33% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss including stock-based compensation and other was $121 million compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.

In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income including stock-based compensation and other was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year.

Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion, or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion, or 5.7% of revenue compared to $706 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was $513 million, or $1.07 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $57 million, or loss of $0.12 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6 down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling inter-Company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in second-quarter 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net.

We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And, with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.

PHIL HARDIN: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Our first question is from Mark May of Citi.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thanks a lot. Lots here, but international retail revenue -- the international retail segment really stood out. Revenue accelerated. Seemed like a bit of a milestone also that the CSOI turned positive in a non-Q4 quarter. Can you shed any more light in what the key driver there was? And, how sustainable it is? And, AWS just mathematically, the comps get tougher starting in Q2, just given what happened in 2014. Is that something that we should be taking into account in terms of thinking about how the rest of the year may progress? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Your first question on international. Yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter. International's 26% for FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in 3.5 years. I would attribute it to the Prime Fly Wheel. As we may have mentioned in the past -- feel that Europe and the large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the US on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015. 47% of that was in the US and a higher rate than that internationally.

So, certainly a lot going on in the international. A lot that's really good adding Prime subscribers at a high clip. Continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So, you'll see devices, you see video content. It's the whole array of Prime offering. Prime Now, Same-day, everything is in Europe. Maybe getting there a little slower than starting point at the US. We see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases.

On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside so I would encourage you to look at recent trends. We don't forecast, obviously, by segment.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. I was hoping you could comment on the overall acceleration we've seen here and key drivers behind that? And, if there's something different perhaps than what you talked about on international?

Also, on AWS, can you talk about the underlying drivers here of margins and thinking about that a little bit going forward primary sources of leverage? As you open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be constant build-out? Or, something that's more lumpy over time and more in waves? Thanks.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil Hardin. I'll take the units question. Really the units are driven by very similar trends to what Brian described. When we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously, units is our key driver of revenue. Things like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth. That has been a big area of focus for us.

One important way we drive selection is through FBA. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from. Obviously, that gives them more they can purchase. It makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more. I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here. Selection growth and Prime though are two very key drivers of our growth. On the second part, I think Brian -- .

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: One other comment I didn't say earlier, I do want to point out that because of the leap year there was an extra day in Q1. Every Company would have seen this obviously. But, we estimate it was worth about 150 basis points to our growth rate in revenue. That would be consistent North America and international.

Your other comment -- question was on AWS and a bit about margins and margin outlook. We're very pleased with the quarter. We came in at 23.5% operating margin on the new basis including stock-based compensation and other. We're very pleased. But, stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business. On the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased, but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business. They'll be bumpy over time. At any point in time, they are going to reflect the balance of investing including global expansion that he's talked about. Price reductions we may offer and also driving cost efficiency which for us is a very important driver in not only this business but also the North American and international segments.

OPERATOR: Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great. Thanks. Looking at the active customer account number, it looks like growth slowed pretty significantly, about 10 percentage points. Just curious if you can give us a sense of anything that might be throwing that number off, assuming we're reading it the right way? And then, as you roll out on AWS -- as you roll out the fixed new availability zones over the course of the year, is there a way to quantify what kind of an impact that's going to have on the capacity at AWS?

PHIL HARDIN: I'll take the first part of your question about active customers. As we look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often make some changes. So, this quarter we only gave the active customers with a paid purchase in the trailing 12 months. So, that number was more than 285 million. I think that's pretty similar to the trend that we've seen in that metric.

In the past, sometimes we had also given a total active customers count. That number for this quarter was over 310 million so that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth. The trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both of those numbers. But, we opted just to give the other one, but you now have the number for the total number of customers as well.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: And, on your AWS footprint question so we ended the quarter with 33 availability zones and 12 geographic regions, and we have 11 more availability zones opening in the next year. The impact on capital, yes, there will be additional capital investment as we build out those zones. Some of it has already taken place. But, I'll also say that by and large, the largest increases in capital leases is to support the growth of incremental usage of customers we have now and agreements we have now. You should expect to see us continue to invest to support this business. We have a leadership position. We intend to maintain it, and we're very excited about where we are.

OPERATOR: Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: The first one is on Prime. You've had two straight years of around 50% Prime subscriber growth. Curious about how you think about keys to driving Prime sub-growth going forward? And, the thought process behind the reported monthly Prime subscription? And, the second one on the logistics investments, there's been a lot about truck investments and logistics investments. Any comments at all about learnings, and what you're seeing from some of the investments in your truck fleet and your own delivery network? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Let me start with the Prime. Yes, we have had very strong growth the last two years and earlier obviously on Prime growth of members. I would say it's a culmination of a lot of separate investments that we're making. If you look at the success of our devices, we are seeing tablets sell twice the volume in Q1 year-over-year. Fire TV stick, you may have read in our press release that it has greater than 100,000 customer reviews, the most reviewed product ever. Over 62,000 of those reviews are 5-star reviews. We've not only had the Echo, but we have the Echo Dot and Tap. We're branching off that product line and having trouble keeping those in stock. And, of course, we launched the new Kindle Oasis, our e-reader.

That is an important part of the series as is the digital content. You may have seen the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new content for Prime members. Customers love the content, and we like the results we see particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime. So, beyond the awards that the content is winning and the success we're having with Amazon particularly Amazon Originals, we feel that program is working. We're going to significantly increase our spend in that area. Some of that is in Q2. You'll see that more in the next few quarters. But, we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base. Both to our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil Hardin. I'll jump in on the second part of your question. For the trucks, really it's trailers. The typical use case is running a lag between a fulfillment center and a sort center. So, we're running enough volume there that we were using trucks already. We thought it made sense to go ahead and buy some trailers. We're actually still contracting out for the truck part, and it gives us flexibility. We think the economics will make sense over time. Similarly, we've announced an agreement to lease some airplanes with air transport services group, agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s there. And, similar use case, it's products that are already boxed, and we think again this is activities we've been doing already which means we grow at a very rapid rate. This gives us extra capacity, and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers. We think it makes sense over the long-term.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Great. Two questions related to Prime overseas. Could you talk about the status of Prime in international markets? How far rolled out it is in most of your major markets? Then, you talk about Prime Fly Wheels, and you did last year. But, it seems likes those Fly Wheels spun faster than you expected in the fourth quarter of last year that caused some near-term expense issues for you? Can you talk about how you're thinking about planning against that as the Prime Fly Wheels are getting broader for you, how do you try to get ahead of that into the peak season later this year? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. This is Brian. Let me start with the second question first. It wasn't necessarily the Prime Fly Wheel that was the issue. It was more the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers for space in our warehouses. We were very full. It was a high-class problem to have.

But, as I mentioned last quarter, it did result in higher fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter as a result. I think you'll see some of that dissipated now in Q1. You can tell it was a Q4 issue.

We learn from every Q4. This one was no exception. We are already making plans for a smoother Q4 next year. We will continue to add fulfillment capacity. We'll work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing, and we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year, come out of the fourth quarter with immense learnings.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. On the Prime question, we launched Prime in the US in 2005. Followed that in 2007 with UK, Germany, and Japan. And then, other countries after. We have Prime in all the countries where we have marketplaces with the exception of Mexico, China, and India.

And, Prime is really in varying stages in those countries. We have some kind of an expedited shipping offer in all of them. Here in the US, we've been talking quite a bit about Prime Now. That's also in Italy and Japan and the UK at this point and not others. Also, varying levels of digital benefits as well.

Generally, the international countries are not as far along with selection or the fullness of the digital offers. We've got Prime Video in the UK, in Germany, and Japan. Music is not fully rolled out yet all together. That's where we are with Prime.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, BERNSTEIN: Thank you. I have two. I think it's the first time 1Q 2011 that we see tech and content counted as a percentage of revenue declining or flat. Is it just a sign of your inability to increase investment in line with revenue growth? Or, is there something going on, if yes, what?

Secondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by investments you have made or are making. You gave the examples of devices that you are selling. I think it's a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers would accelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth. As penetration increases and growth slows, will we see a deceleration in the investment levels? In other words, how do we think about the effect of deceleration in Prime on the North American margin structure in the future? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Let me start with that second one. We think there's a lot of room to grow not only in our international countries but also in the US. We plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video to two-day shipping to same-day shipping to Prime Now. I don't see that dissipating, and it remains the best deal in retail so hopefully everyone signs up for that.

On the tech and content question, I don't have a lot to call out in the quarter. I would say there's no letup in the pace of invention here particularly on the AWS side. We used quote the number of new features and services to you each quarter. We had 214 in Q1 up from the 170 this first quarter of last year. Over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC: Thanks for the question. Any comments on your business in India? How is that market ramping up? On the competitive front there, any sense of where the local incumbents may actually have some advantage in the region? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Thanks. I actually just returned from India where I spent a week with our teams in Bangalore and Hyderabad. We're breaking ground on a new 10-acre campus there. So, we are solidifying and increasing our investment in India on all fronts.

I had a chance to see firsthand the level of invention going on with both customers and sellers making deliveries to customers, seeing the I have space program we have with merchants. It's a very exciting time in India, and again, the invention is off the charts. We're inventing things in India that do not exist in other parts of the world. And, the team there is one of our best. You can see it in some of the external commentary as well. For the second year in a row, customers selected Amazon India as Amazon's most trusted online shopping brand.

During the quarter we rolled out a feature called Tatkal which is a studio on wheels that we go to the sellers to help them sign up. We let them do registration, imaging, catalog, uploads, and basic seller training. We're taking it to the sellers -- taking the business to the sellers. We've already reached sellers in 25 cities, and we're really helping them expand their business. Not only within their home region, throughout the whole country.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thanks. My question is on the international margins. They're quite a bit below where they were many years ago and trailing the US. Maybe talk about the dynamics there and what is it going to take to catch up over time? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. On the op margin side, although there was improvement year-over-year, you're right, it is still on an FX-neutral basis negative. We have, as I said earlier, fulfillment network and digital content. We continue to build the underpinnings of the Prime program in our international countries. You also have to keep in mind that we're making large investments in India. We're very excited about what we see. And, we will continue to invest heavily in India.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Great. I just had two questions on AWS. First, last fall at re:Invent, you disclosed that data management revenue was at a $1 billion run rate. Can you provide an update on that figure? And, maybe talk about how much of AWS revenue today is outside of the storage and compute layers.

And then, the second question is on the AWS margin. I think everybody is trying to learn more about the structural long-term margin, and it was down a tad quarter-on-quarter. Is that solely from FX impact? Or, was there some seasonality of expenses? Any color on what's driving the AWS margin, and how we should think about that over the longer term? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: I'll take your second question first. So, again, we had margin expansion year-over-year that was quite significant from 12.4% to 23.5%. But, again, it's very early in this business. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing on the top and bottom line. But, margins are going to be bumpy and affected by levels of investing, price reductions, and also cost efficiency that we're driving. So, quarter to quarter, it will very. We are concerned at this point about capital efficiency, returning price to customers periodically with price reductions, and adding feature sets for them to make the business more valuable.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. For your other part of the question, we're not providing an update on the $1 billion stat. What I would say is that the AWS team has strong revenue growth across their suite of products. The fastest growing product in their history is actually Aurora, the new database. We're very excited by what we're seeing in that space, but we're not breaking out the revenue for those various components today.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS Investment Research.

ERIC SHERIDAN, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the gross margin, impressive performance in Q1. There were a few headwinds it looked like in gross margin in Q4. Wanted to understand how we should think about the puts and takes in gross margin. It has evolved to be a much higher number in the last few years. What some of the puts and takes are going forward especially with respect to content costs? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. I don't have a forecast for you on content cost in isolation or really forward looks on anything besides the guidance I've given you. Yes, it hits in the gross margin. Content costs do show up there. I think the bigger issues that you should look at in gross margin, and again, starting with the comment that we expanded by 300 basis points year-over-year. That is really driven by, first of all, the AWS growth. And again, $10 billion business growing 64%. We're very pleased with that, and that affects gross margin as well.

The other bigger element though is the third-party contribution. Third-party units are now up to 48% of paid units, and that's up 400 basis points year-over-year. That continues to be a factor in gross margin. We book that on a net basis. The third-party revenue. It's a positive factor in gross margin. It can be a negative factor in fulfillment costs and some of the other metrics.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. Also, just to jump in, gross margin is not the primary metric we use to measure the business. We're much more focused on free cash flow dollars and operating profit dollars. So, there are a whole lot of moving parts in gross margin, and Brian mentioned a lot of them. But, it's not a primary metric for us.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler of Raymond James.

AARON KESSLER, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, INC.: Thanks. Couple of questions. First, if you can update us on your new advertising initiatives in terms of how the sponsored links are performing? Additionally, if you can give us an update on Prime Now. Seems like you've rolled out a number of cities for that. How that's involving and the traction with Prime Now? Thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: We're very excited about the advertising business, and we think it's still very early days for this opportunity. So, it's an offering we've been working on. We're trying to take a very customer-centric approach. You've probably noticed some changes in the treatment on the website, and we did move away from text ads and product ads in favor of some of the other, newer products. We're really excited about the opportunity there is for third-party sellers and for other vendors on the site. But, we're not breaking out numbers today.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: On Prime Now, we're now in 30 metro areas. Really from a standing start 16 months ago when we opened our first Prime Now location, and it's now a worldwide business in the US, UK, Italy, and Japan. The five cities we added in the first quarter were Raleigh, North Carolina, Cincinnati, Tampa, Liverpool, England, and Osaka, Japan.

How do we feel about that business? Again, it offers tens of thousands of daily essential products. We think it's a service that customers like. Certainly is hard for companies to do. We think the natural evolution of our operations network and our scale gives us a chance to do this, and we are happy to invest in it as a service for our customers. We're taking a long-term approach on this one though.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse.

STEPHEN JU, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks. Your capital lease-driven property and equipment acquisitions is down again year-over-year. So, will you help tie this to perhaps the overall usage growth at AWS? Or, maybe the changing nature of how your enterprise customers may be using the platform to be more compute versus storage or database-heavy? I think historically on the e-commerce side, you have been price followers as opposed to price leaders. AWS, you have been price leaders for the most part for actively taking down price. Now, given your leadership position, do you think you'll continue to be price leaders? Or, do you think it's now time for you to follow instead? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Let me start with your CapEx question. We like to look at both capital expenditures and capital leases because they're both essentially our level of investment. Those totaled $9.5 billion in the trailing 12 months, and it was up 7% from the 12-month period ending this quarter last year. I will point out that the prior year was $6.1 billion. We have stepped up investment. Although it did not go up as much year-over-year this quarter, we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment capacity in support of really strong growth -- unit growth in FBA and global expansion and then also on AWS. Additional capacity for existing customers as they grow their business and also in new regions. We've been working and continue to work very hard on capital productivity. It's very important to us and I attribute a good piece of the ability to keep that at a modest growth rate year-over-year to our capital efficiency and better purchasing across all capital and capital leases quite frankly. But, again, we are spending almost $10 billion.

PHIL HARDIN: Stephen, this is Phil. Just to jump on the usage growth comment, we continue to see really strong usage growth. We're not in the business of raising prices. We lower prices for AWS. There can be mix for products, but by and large, if you see our revenue growth, we're also lowering prices which means that by math we're typically going to be growing usage at a very strong rate. Just wanted to jump on that.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from John Blackledge of Cowen and Company.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great. Thanks. The North American EGM segment outperformed our expectations of growth accelerating on a year-over-year basis. Given you don't break out GMV by vertical within the EGM segment and given the strong growth at massive scale, can you cite any key verticals that were particularly strong?

Second question is just an update on Fresh. Rollout has obviously been much slower than Prime Now. How should we think about the Fresh rollout and the impact over the long-term? Thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. I'll take the EGM question first. So, just to put numbers on that, the year-over-year in the US, or North in America, was 32% growth which was up from 28% in Q4. There's not any single categories we're calling out there. To grow on a base that big, that kind of rate, you need pretty strong performance across the board. A lot of categories are selling a lot. It's a lot of the drivers we talked about. As Brian mentioned on the revenue growth side -- Prime, selection growth. We also benefited from the extra day in quarter due to the leap year. Strong performance from many of the categories.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: On Amazon Fresh, we continue to have a strong Fresh business in a number of cities in the US. We know customers love it. We're making good progress on the economics. You'll also notice we have other ways for people to buy consumable products. We have Prime Pantry. We have Prime Now. We're playing with a lot of different models to see what resonates with consumers, and it will guide our investment decisions going forward.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie Equities Research.

BENJAMIN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: First, congratulations on the great quarter. Couple on Prime and one on China. First, a point of clarification. You answered a previous question by saying that you will significantly increase investment in Prime. Was that specifically in reference to video? Or, should we expect new types of offerings beyond video and music?

And, secondly on Prime, membership is likely hitting some saturation levels for certain demographics in the US? Do you intend to focus on more lower income households for growth there? Then finally, on China, anything notable to call out there that's been different over the recent past driving results? The free trade zone, et cetera?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: I'll take the first question on content. Yes, my comment on Prime benefits was essentially one about video content and our investment there. Not saying other investments may not go up as well, but that is the one we're focusing on that I called out.

On the comment about Prime -- I guess what I'll call availability or saturation. I think that's one of the thoughts behind our monthly plan. We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low cost way if that's how they choose. We've always had our free trial program, but it is a hurdle for many people, or there's a hesitancy to put up a full year's payment for a year of Prime. Annual is still going to be a better deal. But, we know customers may try it more frequently if it's a monthly plan. And, that's what we're looking for. We know that once customers try it, generally they'll really like it. So, we think that will purge some other demographic groups as well.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. Another comment on the Prime. Your saturation question. Keep in mind, even in the US, which is our most mature by years of launch, we still grew last year at 47% year-over-year membership growth, and we continue to make the program better and better. I think the monthly offers are great for flexibility. Give people a chance to try new ways, and we continue to add content. We continue to add selection. Prime Now is a huge benefit that didn't even exist two years ago. We're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible. We're very committed to driving Prime and it's part of the Company.

Your question on China, probably the biggest thing to point to is more progress and selection on the Amazon global store. This is our website -- this is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the US website, Amazon.com with prices in RMB and with Chinese language pages. It's focused on items that may be hard to get. And, Amazon is really trying to become the trusted source for many of these goods. So, really that's a big part of the focus. If you've been tracking that number over time, we're now up over $10 million which is good progress on that front.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities.

RON JOSEY, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to North America but focus on margins. 5.5%, 5.4% margins, I think that's the highest level since maybe Q2 2010 and resumes the margin expansion we saw for most of last year. Just hoping we can understand -- help us understand a little more what's driving that? I'm sure the more mature Prime Fly Wheel you mentioned that's happening in Europe. Is there anything else that's going on besides Prime Fly Wheel, maybe more efficient shipping or things along those lines? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: I'll start. You see the growth rate of the segment at 27%. It's showing the success we're having with customers. When we grow at that clip, we can do a lot of good things with it. We can on the cost side run our facilities more efficiently. We can buy better. We can look to in-source some things that we may have paid externally for. There's a number of things that we can do that I think will show up on the bottom line. But, principally, what we're trying to do now is make the Prime experience as strong as possible for consumers.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. The other thing I would add to that is that the margin you see in any quarter is the output of our rate of investment in some places and drive for efficiencies in others. We're not really trying to optimize for any particular number in a given quarter. We're just trying to make the best decisions we can to grow long-term free cash flow per share. We're juggling the investment in the places where we feel like we have long-term opportunities where we need to invest with making sure we're getting continuously better in all our other processes at the same time.

OPERATOR: Our final question will come from Bob Peck of SunTrust.

BOB PECK, ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY: Thank you. Two quick ones. Back to India for a second, I was wondering if you could talk about the regulatory environment there, particularly how it pertains to Amazon cloud tail? Two, on logistics, could you talk about excess capacity in logistics as you build out air, freight, sea, et cetera. Would you ever entertain delivering other Companies' items, i.e., like a FedEx or UPS?

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. I'll take the India question. We're happy to see the recent clarifications. Then, we're happy to operate in any regime. Frankly, the more clarity the better.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Then, on the logistics question. Stepping back, the reason we add logistics capability and transportation capability is so we can serve our customers faster and faster delivery speeds, and we've needed to add more of our own capacity to supplement our carriers and partners. They're still, again, great partners, have been, and will continue to be for the future. But, we see opportunities where we need to add additional capacity, and we're filling those voids.

PHIL HARDIN: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2015 financial results teleconference.

   TD
(Operator Instructions)

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please, go ahead.

PHIL HARDIN, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM INC: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now I will turn the call over to Brian.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY, CFO, AMAZON.COM INC: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion.

Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principle repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principle repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion.

Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares, compared with 483 million one year ago.

Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period.

Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon web services customers exceeded 1 million.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue, compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue, compared with 5.1%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international, and Amazon web services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.

In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion, or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange.

EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion, or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million, compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.

In the Amazon web services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon web services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share.

Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion, or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion, or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.

Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%. Japan revenue grew 19%, and UK revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion.

Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, compared with $178 million in the prior year.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion. And inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion, or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter of 2015.

This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion, compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015.

We are grateful to our customers, and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first, is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.

PHIL HARDIN: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Thank you. Our first question is coming from analyst, Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.

STEPHEN JU, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Okay, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past, you've given some indication as to what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter? And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll say we're -- it's been very strong. AWS revenue is on a -- just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4.

As far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally, what we find is that price is important, but so is speed and agility for customers, and the ability to deliver services and features that are beneficial to them. I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015, and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in this space. And we don't take it for granted, and we want to serve customers better each year.

STEPHEN JU: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is from analyst, Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.

JASON HELFSTEIN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER & CO.: Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics in fourth quarter, eCommerce, particularly in the US? Did we see more aggressive promotional activity? And maybe talk about how you tried to work that to continue to drive the Prime number of members going forward? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Well, what I can say is our approach to pricing has not changed. And through Q4, we did everything we could to have the best prices available for customers, and in-stock in time for the holiday. Another dynamic of Q4 was that, it was a huge FBA quarter. Nearly 50% of our third-party units were FBA, and our third-party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, so up 400 basis points year-over-year.

So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers, using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses, and we were full. It was a very busy quarter, and it did increase some of our variable costs as a result, primarily in the US. But a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded our -- even our expectations.

JASON HELFSTEIN: Perhaps how are you able to integrate that into holiday promotions?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: I'm sorry. You cut off there. Could you repeat your question?

JASON HELFSTEIN: Sure. Just any additional color around Prime, and how you were able to integrate that into holiday promotions?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Nothing specific. I will say, one interesting enhancement this year was our Prime Now service, which allowed people to order in selected markets up until 11:59 on New Year -- or excuse me, Christmas Eve. So that was a valuable service to many late shoppers, last-minute shoppers.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.

ARAM RUBINSON, ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH: Hey, thanks very much. Two questions, both on the logistics side. It seems pretty clear that you guys are trafficking in some old world assets, like truck trailers, and ship lanes, and air fields. Can you help, give us a sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish with that? If it's defensive to protect your service to your existing customers, or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure, Aram. Thanks for your question. I would say that -- what we've found, is in order to properly serve our customers at peak, we've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners. That's not meant to replace them, and those carriers are just not -- no longer able to handle all of our capacity that we need at peak. They have been, and continue to be great partners, and we look forward to working with them in the future.

It's just we've had to add some resources on our own. You mentioned trucks. The Amazon trucks, we did invest in those this past year. We use those primarily for movement between our warehouses and our sort centers.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two. The first one is just on gross margins. I think they were down about 200 basis points sequentially. It's the biggest fall in the fourth quarter in quite sometime. Anything you would call out there? Is it devices, or more sortation centers? Is there anything pressuring gross margins we should think about in the fourth quarter?

And then on the fulfillment line, you mentioned FBA being a big driver of the growth in the fulfillment costs. Anything else you would call out, leading to incremental fulfillment costs? Maybe India or something else? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: No. And again, keep in mind, that the fulfillment as a percent of revenue is impacted by the calculation of FBA revenue being a net number, as opposed to a full revenue number. But our fulfillment costs per unit actually decreased year-over-year. It's just that we are now shipping more and more of our -- other than demand, out of our warehouses because of the strength in retail and FBA.

On gross margin, I -- first, I'll caution you and say, we would encourage you to look at free cash flow which was -- it grew at a minimum $4 billion on each of the metrics that we point out. And Op profit, which was up 88% year-over-year. If you look sequentially, also keep in mind that in Q3, when it was up about 500 basis points year-over-year, that was lapping the write-down of our Amazon phone inventory the prior year. So there was a little bit of noise in the Q3 number. But generally, again, we're happy with the ability to service customers, the reaction of customers in Q4, and the bottom line results that we had.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: Great, thanks. One follow-up, and then another question. On the logistics and transportation side, I was curious if that's to date, just to supplement some of the other carriers? But more broadly or longer term, is there an ambition from the services side, to perhaps provide capacity to other companies?

And then on AWS margins, was just wondering if we should expect more leverage there going forward? And whether Q1, whether that should demonstrate some seasonality, versus what we've seen in terms of sequential growth in prior years? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Let me work backwards -- don't give guidance by segment, so cannot really comment on AWS specifically in Q1. The -- and the operational improvements -- excuse me, the gross margin -- the operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase reductions and purchase prices, and also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have. So we're very happy with that.

Keep in mind that we did have -- although the year-over-year increase in capital expenditures and capital leases was not as great as we saw in 2013 to 2014, we did spend over $9 billion on those -- on capital, and expenditures and capital lease obligations, up from prior year was -- excuse me -- (multiple speakers)

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question come -- (multiple speakers)

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sorry, let me finish my answer to him, please? We grew up, we grew from in the $5 billion range in 2013, to $8.9 billion in 2014, and now over $9 billion in 2015.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.

KEN SENA, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI: Hi. So a lot of headlines around Amazon's activity at SunDance. I was hoping maybe you could expand once more on the video strategy, and specifically are you seeing an inflection in Prime Video usage? And maybe, just also on your streaming partners program, what the general reception is like? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. We're very thrilled with the customer response to Prime Video. Again, when Prime Video is used by our Prime members, it drives adoption and retention, higher free trial conversion rates, and higher renewal rates for subscribers. So what we were encouraged by in Q4 was that globally, we doubled the number of -- our Prime members doubled the number of viewing hours of the Prime Video year-over-year. And internationally, we had twice as member Prime members streaming year-over-year. So very encouraged by the pick up, and the response of customers.

The other comment I would say about video is, we're very happy with the Amazon studios content, in particular. We've had some great success in 2014 and 2015. As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself. Mozart in the Jungle just won two Golden Globe Awards.

So very pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content, and we've got a lot of new content coming out this year. Catastrophe Season 2, Bosch Season 2, we're all looking forward to. And in February, we will have Chi-Raq, our first original movie that we got to work with Spike Lee on, which won many critical -- made many critics' Best Films list in 2015. That will be coming to Prime Video in February.

PHIL HARDIN: Just to add to that, this is Phil. On your question about the streaming partners program, so that's our new over-the-top streaming subscription program for Prime members. We think it's a really convenient way for them to access additional content, content from sources like ShowTime and Starz. And it's really early, so it's just out of the gate, but we've been very pleased with what we've seen so far.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Two things, please. Any call outs on the macro side? Occasionally, you called anything -- you've called things out, anything this time? And then, could you talk a little bit about Amazon business?

I know that there is a little bit of a line in the press release on it. I know you've had this for a couple of years. But any indications to the materiality of that, the kind of momentum it's gaining, the kind of traction it's gaining? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. No macroeconomic comments. Again, we feel we're very encouraged by the customer response to our offerings in Q4.

Amazon business, yes, in April, you may remember we launched it as a marketplace, with specific features and benefits for businesses. That -- Amazon business now serves more than 200,000 businesses, from small organizations to Fortune 500 companies. So it's still early, but we're encouraged, and we think we're creating some value, a lot of value for our business customers.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thanks. Brian, question on the international retail business. I think you added well over $1 billion in revenue year-on-year in the quarter, but from a CSOI perspective, you really didn't see any improvement there. I'm sure there is -- there are a lot of different things going on.

I just wonder if you could unpack that a little bit, and give us a sense of what profitability looks like maybe in some of your more mature, established countries and regions, relative to the investments you're making in other countries? So that we can kind of get a better picture of what's actually going on under the hood there? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes. Sure, Mark. Thanks for your question. We are very pleased by the international growth, 22% FX neutral, was up 1,000 basis points year-over-year. We saw that the -- we told you that the Prime growth, Prime membership growth, 50% in -- excuse me, 51% globally. 47% in the US means that the international Prime programs grew at a faster clip than that. So very, very pleased with the uptick.

We rolled out a lot of additional Prime features internationally as well this year, from free same-day, to Prime Now, to Prime Music, and Prime Video in Japan, to name a few. So very happy with that. But in general, if I step back, our investments in national are twofold.

First, there's the Prime platform and all the features I just mentioned, including the fulfillment, adding more fulfillment resources to handle higher and higher retail volumes, and a very strong FBA program as well. And then, the remainder -- the biggest other investment area is obviously India. And we like -- we continue to see, like what we see in India. In Q4, Amazon India was the top e-commerce site in India, throughout the very busy -- Diwali shopping season, including the shopping season, according to comScore.

And sales by sellers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined, in Q4. So seeing great progress with downloads, innovations for sellers and customers alike. And we like the ramp there, and we're continuing to invest in India.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking the question. Two things. Just first, on the North America EGM growth, if you could just talk about the 28% there? And the decel on an easier comp, and whether there's any particular factors within that we should be thinking about? And perhaps, if there was any weather and apparel impact there?

And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something along the lines of, being able to invest as you would like, and also deliver good profit, and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as it has in the past. Is that statement and thought still hold, as you head into 2016? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Let me start with EGM. So EGM growth, North America EGM growth of 28% was actually also the highest in the last four years. So we're happy with that.

The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate, revenue growth rate. So sequentially last year, in North America EGM, we dropped from 31% to 27%.

This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always a -- generally, a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well, in total customer satisfaction.

Your other question, investments. Yes, we continue to have healthy investments as we've stated across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is, we want to find things, businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns, and are durable. They can last for decades. We think Prime is that, we think Marketplace is that, we think AWS is that, and we are constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria.

But as we continue to invest primarily in, as I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for fulfillment capacity, as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance, and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies, in fixing variable productivity. I think a thing to think about is, the investments will ebb and flow over time, but our focus on cost reductions and improvement on customer experience will be constant.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense, as we look at the slowing growth in AWS, obviously, still from an incredibly high level, and still very strong growth there. But try and take that into context, with the growth in margins that you keep seeing in that business, to levels that certainly seem a lot higher than you would anticipate for an Amazon business. Is there any capacity constraint or management that, that's driving pricing strategy in AWS?

We've heard the comments about the number of availability zones that are being launched this year, which is obviously about a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business. I'm just trying to balance those, think about how we should balance those three things?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We have -- we just announced Korea as a region. And we'll be adding five more regions in the next, in the future, in the near future as we mentioned. CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures, in particularly in AWS. And we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers.

CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014. It grew even more to over $9 billion, across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. From the new regions, they are not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity, and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions, and existing customers' demand growth. But there's certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region, so we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015.

But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint. And I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on the -- yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3. But as I've said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business. On a dollar basis, we continue to grow. We saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And again, we continue to invent, it's not all about price-- we continue to innovate on behalf of customers, and see great customer response.

HEATH TERRY: Sure, sure. Got it. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kerry Rice with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.

KERRY RICE, ANALYST, NEEDHAM & COMPANY: Thanks a lot. First question is, if you can provide maybe some context around linearity within Q4, more as a -- compared to your expectations? Obviously, you have a ramp-up into the holiday season, but was -- did December tail off faster than you expected, or did the ramp-up, did it spike higher than you expected? And then, just on the follow-up, maybe can you add some context about how the mobile played a role in the holiday season for Amazon? Thanks.

PHIL HARDIN: So in terms of -- this is Phil. In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4. And if you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue. So no real call outs there. I think, what was your second part of your question?

Oh, and mobile, we said for a long time continues to be a tail wind for the business. We're working very hard to make sure that it's very easy for customers to buy the things they want to buy, and access a lot of the features they have grown accustomed to on the website. And so, we're very focused on the convenience factor. And if you look at some of our new offerings like Prime Now that's available through a mobile app, and very, very convenient for customers. And as Brian has mentioned, allowed them to shop even up to Christmas Eve, and then have their items delivered in two hours.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, BERNSTEIN: Thank you. I have two. I want to go back to AWS margins. You talked briefly about purchasing an asset utilization. But do this explain the 800 bps or so, on your year-on-year margin expansion?

And are you seeing anything else? Like is there any impact of scale driving leverage over fixed costs? Is there some benefit from revenue mix shift, like services, like Aurora and RedShift growing faster than EC2, or is all the margin expansion due to purchasing and asset utilization? So that's the first question.

And the second, I have a question about your streaming content expenses or cost of revenues to be more precise. Last year, you told us they were $1.3 billion, but if you didn't give us a figure for 2015. In lieu of that, can you comment on whether 4Q saw higher than usual costs for streaming content, compared to other quarters in the year? Thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: Carlos, this is Phil. So your question about the AWS margins, that business as they continued to learn, and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive costs out of that business. And so, that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you've seen in margin year-over-year.

There is also an FX tail wind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises, because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world. As for the streaming content, we haven't given another update this year, and haven't given any commentary on the profile quarter to quarter.

OPERATOR: Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC: Thank you. You mentioned Amazon Dash in the press release. Can you give us some color around how you're viewing the traction there, both with customers, and with brands and devices? And then, maybe any update on Twitch? How is traffic and user engagement been trending on that site? Thanks.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. So on the Dash buttons, we're really excited about what we're delivering there. I think, as you saw in the release, there are some new devices that take advantage of the underlying service, that we think will be really convenient for sellers, and interesting for device makers. We're excited about what we're building there. I don't have any stats for you today.

On the Twitch side, we continue to let Twitch do what Twitch does best. And so, don't have any updates on numbers there, but they continue to really engage customers, and offer a really unique experience, which was one of the reasons we were attracted to them to start with.

BRIAN PITZ: And maybe just quickly, end of year fulfillment and sortation centers?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, I'll take that. So we ended the year at 123 fulfillment centers, up a net 14, and we have 20 -- excuse me, 23 sortation centers in the US, up 4 year-over-year.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: Hey, good afternoon. I want to just quickly revisit the margin pendulum question in some of your comments, as you mentioned that to kind of expect it to ebb and flow. Could you tell us if you expect it to ebb and flow, but moving higher? Or is ebb and flow just mean that, that it's kind of undetermined in 2016? And then, a second follow-up, is the robotics. Any update in terms of number of robots, or how you see that expansion going forward? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, my comment on ebb and flow was more about the investment, and also including capital expenditures and capital leases. So not around gross margins. And merely, I was pointing out that again, we've laid out all the invested areas, where we're seeing heavy investment. We continue -- we see the continuation of that certainly, into 2016 and beyond.

There are quarter-to-quarter and even year-to-year fluctuations in some accounts, and some investment areas. But generally, we're pretty transparent on where we're investing our dollars. And against that backdrop, we are always looking for efficiency. And the nice thing about growing the top line at such a high clip, is we have a lot more areas for opportunity to save money year-over-year. And we always look to do that.

PHIL HARDIN: And this is Phil. On the Kiva question, the last update we've given is more than 30,000 robots. We continue to be really pleased with the program, and like what it does in the warehouse, both from a density of storage, as well as from making the jobs easier for the associates who are picking packages, by bringing the packages actually to the associates. But no new numbers on that.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you. Two questions. Was there any category mix impacts in the quarter on gross margins? That's just a quick one.

And then secondly, as you look back at last year, you had some quarters where you really exceeded your guidance on the CSOI line. Maybe looking back, or just looking forward, what are the types of things that causes you to come in at the high end, versus maybe the low end, when you look back, or when you look forward? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. First, on guidance, we keep it pretty, a consistent process on how we look at guidance, and how we estimate the near-term view of the business. I will point out that Q4 is obviously, a very large quarter, the largest revenue quarter by far of the year. There's a lot of demand that comes in the last six weeks of the year as well.

So very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do the call. So we are using are best projections on a lot of fronts. We think it's a similar -- we know it's a consistent process. And there are times, when we under-run and sometimes we over run it.

PHIL HARDIN: On the -- this is Phil. On the category mix question, obviously, category mix does play a role in gross margin. I would say though, that we're much more focused on operating profit dollars, and free cash flow dollars, as we've probably talked about before.

The gross margins are impacted by first-party versus third-party mix, as well as AWS mix, if you're looking at the total for the Company. So we're much more focused on the dollars. And no specific categories we're calling out, as a driver for gross margin, because, again, we're much more focused on the profit dollars.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.

PAUL VOGEL, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Great. Thanks. Just wonder if you could give an update on the strategy around same-day shipping? How we should think about kind of further expansion of that? And kind of what parameters do you guys use to determine what markets to go in? Is it density of the market? Is it proximity of your distribution facilities? Just some color on that would be great.

PHIL HARDIN: So we deliver, really quickly, a couple of ways. One is the free same-day, that you've seen us roll out in a number of markets in the US. The other is Prime Now. And we're now in more than 25 metropolitan areas for Prime Now. Delivering for free in two hours is difficult and expensive, but customers love it.

So we feel like this is the natural evolution of our delivery, and we're happy to invest in that service. We like what it does for Prime members. We like the convenience factor. And so, we're taking a long-term approach, and doing what we normally do, which is really focus on continuing to drive greater and greater efficiency.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.

RONALD JOSEY, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask more about North American operating margins, because I think they expanded just under 50 bps this quarter to 4.7%. And that compares to an average of 200 basis points thereabouts, expansion in the prior three quarters.

So I'm just wondering, if in 4Q maybe higher FPA costs or something else in there that led to, maybe an expansion not as great as we saw in prior quarters. And then, following up on the Prime Now question just now, I'm wondering how an hour delivery or two-hour delivery has changed a consumer's perception of just delivery overall? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Yes, again, I'll point out that the demand for FBA services was very high, nearly 50% of our third-party units, again were FBA. And the demand for space and services was very large by our seller base, which was great from a lot of standpoints, and it did exceed our expectations. But did make our warehouses rather full, and did cause us to incur some additional variable costs in the US. And there is also the dynamic that we were fulfilling more of these units ourselves, at our warehouses because of the FBA growth, and the retail growth.

PHIL HARDIN: On the speed of delivery, this is Phil. All I can say is, the customers love the service. It's very convenient, and it gives them flexibility, and the ability to get products really quickly. I don't know that there's any big trends we are ready to call out at this point, but they seem to really, really like it. So we're encouraged by that. We're excited to invest in it, and excited what we can do for our Prime members.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.

NEIL DOSHI, ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES CO., LTD.: Great. Two questions, please. One, it seems like the Echo did perform well. Can you talk more broadly about your Internet of Things ambitions, and kind of how Echo plays into that strategy?

And then, secondly, just wanted to know a little bit more about restaurant delivery? It seems a little bit outside of the wheelhouse. What's the impetus behind doing more in terms of food delivery, and what are your ambitions there? Thanks.

PHIL HARDIN: So on the Echo, we like what -- how Echo has done. We're really excited about the ecosystem, and some of the skills that are being added to Echo, as well as some of the other devices that are taking advantage of Alexa, which is the brains behind Echo. So we like our device business in general.

As you probably saw from the press release, we had a good Q4, where we did almost double the, or double what we did last year, so very excited about the devices. We like that they pump more energy into Prime, and really the whole ecosystem. Not sure on the Internet of Things, but it's very exciting for devices standpoint. And the brains of Echo are in the AWS cloud. And so, Echo gets new capabilities all the time, as Alexa gets better and better.

On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. This is tied in with the Prime Now offering in a handful of cities at this point. And so, we have the delivery people going out and making the deliveries in the neighborhoods. And so, this is one more really valuable convenient service we can offer for our Prime customers.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our final question will come from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great, thanks. Two questions. First one, shipping costs were higher than we expected. I think it was 12.5% of net revenue, versus 11% last year.

Just any color on the higher shipping costs? And is that percentage of net revenue a new normal, as we are in 2016 now, and as we look out? And then the second question on Prime Now, in 25 markets globally, how should we think about the total number of markets that, additional markets you can enter with the Prime Now offering in 2016? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Yes, as you say, the net shipping margin was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Again, this is all tied in with the increase in FBA growth, and the demand from Prime members. We're shipping more units -- more of our units, so this ripples through our ship cost per unit. And, again, the calculation of ship costs, as margin is a percent of revenue, and that is impacted by the denominator effect on the FBA sales, being booked at a net revenue.

PHIL HARDIN: Related to your Prime Now question, this is Phil. We're in more than 25 metropolitan locations. It's -- if you've been watching, this roll out has really happened in the last year, so it's been a pretty rapid rollout. We're excited to bring it to more places.

We don't have a target for you today, but we are working hard to bring it to more and more places. We're outside the US now in a handful of countries, in the UK and Japan and Italy, and working to expand. So it's a program we're really excited about, and we're happy to bring it to more customers.

Thank you for joining us on the call today, and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2015 financial results teleconference.

   TD
(Operator Instructions)

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.

PHIL HARDIN, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect Management's views as of today, October 22, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY, CFO, AMAZON.COM INC.: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 72% to $9.8 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion. Trailing 12-months free cash flow less lease principal repayments was $3.1 billion, up from an outflow of $99 million. Trailing 12-months free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and capital acquired under capital leases was $637 million, up from an outflow of $2.3 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.4 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

Combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 489 million shares compared with 481 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $25.4 billion or 30% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer counts was approximately 294 million, excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 272 million, up from approximately 244 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide seller units represented 46% of paid units, up from 42% in the comparable prior-year period.

Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.8 billion or 66.1% of revenue compared with 71.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.6 billion or 30.1% of sales, up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.1 billion or 12.3% of revenue, compared with 12.4%. Tech and content was $2.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue compared with 10.8%. Marketing was $1.2 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 4.7%.

Now, I will talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 28% to $15 billion or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Media revenue grew 8% to $3 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 35% to $11.8 billion. EGM now represents 79% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income was $528 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared to a loss of $60 million in the prior-year period. North America segment operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.

In the International segment, revenue increased 7% to $8.3 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 24%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $2.3 billion or increased 6% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 14% to $5.9 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 71% of International revenues. International segment operating loss was $56 million compared to a loss of $174 million in the prior-year period. International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.

In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 78% to $2.1 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $521 million, a 25% operating margin compared to $98 million in the prior-year period. AWS segment operating income includes $78 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.

Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $25 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $406 million compared to a loss of $544 million in the prior-year period. Our income tax expense was $161 million. GAAP net income was $79 million or $0.17 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $437 million or a loss of $0.95 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $7.5 billion year-over-year to $14.4 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $9 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 22% to $14.4 billion and accounts payable days increased to 79 from 74 in the prior year.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such a settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effects on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where the have been recently.

For Q4 2015, we expect net sales of between $33.5 billion and $36.75 billion, or growth of between 14% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion, compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $620 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $700 million and $1.9 billion, compared to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.

We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks and with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.

PHIL HARDIN: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Scott Devitt, Stifel Nicolaus.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. The first question Brian, International retail growth continues to improve and I was wondering if you can just talk through some of the dynamics there understand the consumption tax in Japan comp? You have some real markets where you have physical infrastructure now in Europe and then also the dynamics in India and China as contributors. And then secondly, maybe if you could just given how profitable AWS has become, if you could framework for thinking about the long-term profitability of that business? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: On International yes, you are right, first of all, the FX neutral growth of 24% year-over-year is up 200 basis points versus Q2 and up 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Some of that is due to the comping of the JP consumption tax increase in April of last year which we said last year, impacted Q2 and Q3 and not really impact in Q4. We are seeing the last of that on the comp.

But the impact of Prime Day globally we estimated about 200 basis points and we saw a pickup in both. I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that as International as well. That was great event for -- a great day for customers, Amazon and sellers alike. The base International growth is really being driven by Prime adoption, greater selection, greater Prime selection including FBA. So it is essentially the same playbook as the US. The additional Prime features, we launched a Prime Now location in the UK this quarter. Not materially going to impact the entire continent but it is a good start. So we like the trends in International and they mirror many of the same things we see in North America.

On AWS, the business model there, let me talk about margin which was up sequentially from Q2 from 21.4% to 25%. We're continuing to see great acceleration in the pace of innovation. We've launched 530 new significant features this year which is more than last year already. We continue to lower prices. We've lowered prices eight times since a rather large price cut in April of 2014 -- excuse me, April of 2014. And we like the customers are really responding. They like the speed and agility that AWS provides them. They like the new features that we launched, many of which are also enable them to lower their cost of infrastructure.

Amazon Aurora, one-tenth the price of other high-end commercial databases, a new storage class of Amazon S3 QuickSight also very effective and cost-effective products for our customers. So like AWS, the model remains in early days and we enjoy leading this business and customers have responded well and we believe we are adding new services and features at a rate faster than many others. But the growth rates and margins will certainly remain lumpy and bumpy as we go forward. But we are very encouraged by the business and so are customers.

OPERATOR: Mark May, Citi.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Hello? Can you hear me?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes.

MARK MAY: Okay. Thanks. Question hopefully it hasn't been asked already is around AWS margins were obviously quite strong in the quarter. Can you speak to the sustainability of the margin improvement that we've seen there and what is your long-term expectations for profit margins for this business? And if you give us a sense of what CapEx for this segment of the business look like in the quarter and the rate of growth that would be helpful. And then secondly, your employee adds were fairly strong in the quarter as well. Wonder if you could call out any particular areas within the business where you are strengthening your hiring efforts? Thanks.

PHIL HARDIN: So this is Phil. I will take the AWS portion. I'll echo what Brian said earlier. This is a young and rapidly growing business and as you've seen looking backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure timing can be bumpy. We are taking a very long-term view on this business. We are excited about the potential there and really the team's focused on just keeping their heads down and continue to accelerate the pace of innovation to try to continue to grow the functionality gap we think we offer. A lot of hard work going on there. But again, we're take a long-term view on the business and interested in helping customers as much as possible in that space.

On the CapEx, again, we are focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across all of Amazon but we are also certainly investing in growth. On the AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world. Certainly additional servers to support the strong growth we have and some of the expense for things like data centers or new regions can be a little lumpy and we've mentioned a couple of new regions we are working on throughout the world. So that's going on as well.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Mark, on your headcount question, you are right, the headcount was up 49% year-over-year which is higher than Q2 -- we saw in Q2. This is going to be primarily our Ops area. If you exclude Ops related employees, our headcount's growing actually slower than our FX neutral growth rate of 30%. So what's going on in Ops is we've added 14 net fulfillment centers this year bringing the total to 123 globally. We've added four sort centers in the US bringing the US footprint to 23. We're staffing earlier in those locations. We are in good shape for the holidays and ready to go. The other issue -- is there any other reason is that we are also doing a live conversion of temp workers to full-time workers purposefully. This a metric of employment of full-time hires so it is a little bit higher due to that program.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: I'm tempted to ask about the long-term margins for AWS but I won't. Can you talk about two areas? One, the EGM growth in North America, it is accelerated really strongly. Any color behind what's in particular categories that are driving that? And secondly, there's been -- you've made some public comments in the last eight months about some on the retail side about investments internationally. Particularly in India. Could you refresh us on what kind of levels suspend you're interested in targeting in that market? And then, maybe as part of that, any comments on China and how well you think you're doing there now? Thanks a lot.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. On a EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection both our retail selection and also our third-party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible. And then just the responsiveness of our customers, especially our Prime customers to the EGM product line. We are very encouraged with the EGM growth.

And on India, I will not -- excuse me. I won't give specific dollar numbers on investment but I can give you an update on India. We are really encouraged with what we are seeing both on the customer side and the seller side. On the customer side, active customer accounts were up 230% year-over-year. We're in the middle of the Dewali season. That is going really well. Sales are 4X what they were last year. So customers are responding greatly this year. We continue to invest. We've been adding products at the rate of 40,000 products per day so far this year.

And just as big is the number of sellers, the sellers -- the number of sellers has grown more than 250% year-over-year. 90% of those sellers are using our logistics and warehouse services. As a result, we have tripled our fulfillment capacity year-over-year. We are very encouraged, as I said last quarter, in India, and continue to invest there very heavily.

PHIL HARDIN: Mark, I think you asked about China as well. This is Phil. We're continuing to work on some of the items we've been talking about for a couple quarters now. So the team has some interesting ideas. Really focused on making Amazon a trusted conduit for Chinese customers to access authentic International branded products and things that customers cannot get.

I think Amazon Global Store continues to expand the selection there. We added about another 400,000 items to that store this quarter and continue to focus on using our global network of vendors to be able to get those products to customers. We continue to test the store on TMall as well. And the team has some other ideas but that's what we are talking about so far.

OPERATOR: Eric Sheridan, UBS Investment Research

ERIC SHERIDAN, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks for taking the question. Can you call out in terms of the 3P business what you are seeing in terms of third-party sellers maybe needing to make more and more of their goods Prime eligible? What the economics of that might be in terms of creating a tailwind for the business and how we should think about that evolving over the next couple of years? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure, Eric. What I can tell you is the 3P percent of revenue continues to grow for now up to 46% of paid units, which is up 400 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially off Q2. We feel that Prime and FBA are reinforce each other, they are inextricably linked. FBA adds Prime selection and Prime growth attracts more FBA sellers. So we have seen growth in FBA. It increases our Prime fast-track eligible selection, which we like and customers like, so we like what we see in the third-party side.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you. We did see the acceleration in EGM. I was just wondering if some of the local delivery and Prime Now is driving that acceleration? Is that having a big impact on your business? And down the road, do you think the delivery infrastructure will be valuable in maybe delivering third-party and other units? Thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. It still pretty early for a lot of the really expedited delivery options. We've been working on our network for about 20 years to be able to enable some of the really fast delivery with things like Prime Now. But at this point, we are in a relatively small list of cities but it is expanding pretty fast. I think we launched it a couple more Prime Now cities just today. So that brings us up to about 17 across the globe.

On the same day, here in the US, we continue to expand that as well. But we think that those fast options add us to the consideration set of a customer's purchase on some purchases that we might not otherwise be included in. But at this point, we are still working on that and getting it up to speed. So nothing specific to call out on that. On the other part of your question, we continue to work on the network around the world but cannot respond to any of the rumors and speculation.

OPERATOR: Robert Peck, SunTrust.

KUNAL MADHUKAR, ANALYST, SUNTRUST: Thanks for letting me ask a question. This is Kunal for Bob. Quick question on India, is there any change or any indication that there might be a change in the regulatory framework that would allow you to go direct?

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. I don't know that we have anything to comment on all of that.

KUNAL MADHUKAR: Thanks.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask the most frequent investor question and concern that we get is when will Amazon flip back to its heavier spending and investment ways from 2014 and earlier? So I wanted to ask, is that a legitimate question do you think or are you now at a point of scale and market share and maturity that you could sustainably manage the heavy invest and while still delivering material profit? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, thanks, Doug. I will point out that this quarter showed a lot of innovation, a lot of new products and features and a lot of investment. We've already talked about India, but domestically, we're -- excuse me, globally we are investing very heavily in our Prime platform both in North America and International. And that includes video content and original content, Prime Music, as Phil just said, the Prime Now has been expanded to 14 Metro areas, we have had same day delivery in now in 16 metro areas, we've built 14 new fulfillment centers, we've launched multiple devices including e-readers, tablets that are priced under $50, Echo, Dash Button.

So there's a lot of investment going on and there will be continue especially related to Prime. And on the AWS side, as I said, we have 530 new features so far this year. So innovation and investment will continue and can be lumpy. I hate to use that word again, but could be lumpy over time. The other dynamic in our Company though is definitely working on cost reductions and efficiency. I think you see a lot of that in this quarter's P&L and in our capital efficiency, both in the warehouse world and also in infrastructure.

So we will continue to work on costs. The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well. So we will -- I would say it is not as much as a pendulum as maybe it's been portrayed, it is more of a constant. The investment will, it sometimes ebbs and flows but the cost reductions will be a constant presence and the increase in customer experience and shortening the time to delivery in making the customer experience better.

OPERATOR: Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTL: Thanks for taking my questions. You guys had the Kindle store in Brazil since December of 2012. Just curious about the learnings around that and what benchmarks are you analyzing as you try to determine whether or not to invest further in a larger Brazil store?

The second one, just curious for comments on International Prime sub growth. It sounds like Prime subs are growing really well. I think a couple quarters ago, you mentioned how they are growing over 50%. Is that still the case and if so, what is driving that faster International Prime sub growth?

PHIL HARDIN: On the Brazil side, this is Phil, we've had the Kindle store in Brazil for a while. I think we look at all of our investments within an eye towards trying to maximize long-term free cash flow at strong returns on invested capital. That's across the Board. That's the criteria we are using, making sure we're building things that customers love that can have attractive financial returns over time and can persist for a long time and if they work, can be big. That's the metrics we are using. There's nothing specific to call out to Brazil though.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: This is Brian. We are not going to update our Prime subscription growth beyond what we said last year or the end of last year, which last year in the year when we raised prices early in 2014, the global growth rate was 53% and North America growth rate was 50%. So by default, the International growth rate was higher. We like the adoption of Prime internationally, it is helped by additional selection that's available for fast-track shipment including FBA. So that fly wheel is working.

We've also launched video benefits, most recently in Japan, but we have them in UK and Germany. We continue to launch other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter. We launched Prime Now in the UK. So it is very similar to the US story potentially time lagged a bit but we are seeing the same customer adoption and impact on growth rates.

OPERATOR: Carlos Kirjner, Bernstein.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, BERNSTEIN: Thank you. I have two questions. You have told us that you have tens of millions of Prime users, that you are investing heavily in Prime. Now at this scale and the 50% plus growth rates that you just mentioned, if you roll the clock two or three years, one can see Prime penetration in markets like the US starting to saturate as judges so many homes in the country. How should we think about the level of investment in Prime once you reached full penetration? Are there components that are given primarily to customer acquisition and what's the right way to think about that?

And secondly, what are the economic drivers that justify the business case for Prime Now? I don't expect you to give us any numbers, I've learned that lesson in the last few years, but what are the components of the customer lifecycle value calculation or what type of calculation that you make to justify someone dropping a box with that $15 order to a customer? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure, thank you, Carlos. First, what I will classify as Prime demographics. So yes, we still think there's a lot of people in the country who are not Prime members and we are anxious to have them try it and sign up and join. The other thing that we see is that with our vast offering of selection and faster and faster shipping programs, we have a more competitive offering for many things that they buy. So there's a share of wallet element to it as well over time that we are looking to be more useful to customers all the time.

On your comment about the economic drivers of Prime Now. You know what I will say is, customers really value it. It is not our entire selection, it is tens of thousands of items that they may need on a daily basis. We think it is an interesting part of the selection offer for Prime and it's in many ways something that we can do that others cannot because it is a natural evolution of our 20-year effort to grow our fulfillment center network and our scale, quite frankly, makes it possible to even offer this to customers.

OPERATOR: Neil Doshi, Mizuho Securities.

NEIL DOSHI, ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES: Great. Thanks, guys. Can you talk a little bit more about India and what is the opportunity there that you see? There's a tremendous amount of -- tremendous middle-class there but the distribution can be very challenging. So is that an area where we could see Amazon really building out the last mile? And then there's been some reports of an Amazon potentially trying to close the GAAP in terms of delivery and deliver sooner. On the grocery side, what is the impetus there and can we see how is the recent market's been trending on the grocery side that you've launched recently? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: I will take the India question. So again, India is a different market and does not have a lot of the same ready fulfillment options that some other countries did. We see that as an opportunity, an opportunity that we can build and we can bring to sellers. And as I believe I already mentioned, we like what we see, we are very encouraged, customer accounts, active customer counts are up 230% year-over-year and sellers, number of sellers is up 250% year-over-year. 90% of those sellers use our logistics and warehouse services, as you mentioned, which has caused us to triple our fulfilment capacity. We are happy to do so. We like what we see in India. We think we have, we're attractive both to customers and to sellers and we like our position.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil. On the grocery side, for Fresh we are in a handful of metropolitan areas here in the US. It is been a relatively measured rollout by Amazon standards. We continue to work on the customer experience and making sure we are really delivering a quality experience for shoppers. We are also working on the economics. And so, we've continued to work on that, but not much new to add right now.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great. Thanks. I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense how some of the recent announcements from FedEx and UPS about pricing during the holidays and the structure of some of the third-party relationships might impact you? And given the investments that you've made in your own fulfillment infrastructure, how much of a competitive advantage you feel like you've got during the holiday season as other retailers have -- that are more directly exposed to these changes have to deal with it?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: No comment on the pricing. I would say that we have 23 sort centers which allows us to control a lot more of our shipments for longer but we certainly value our relationships with USPS, FedEx, UPS and other global carriers. And we are looking forward to a great holiday season.

OPERATOR: Aaron Kessler, Raymond James.

AARON KESSLER, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, INC.: Yes, hi guys. Can you quickly, if you can talk about some of the more experimental projects you work on? I guess the travel business, you're in again for a few months and then got out of. Also, maybe with just restaurant, providing restaurant delivery. How do you view these services? They're not necessarily core to what you do, obviously you can provide those services. But how should we think about these types of investments longer-term? Thanks.

PHIL HARDIN: On destinations, we're constantly trying new things and testing and measuring and iterating here at Amazon and we learned a lot but we've discontinued that. On the restaurant delivery, we've had it for a couple months here in Seattle and recently announced it in Portland, and it fits very well with Prime Now. At this point, it is pretty small but something we are excited to do for customers. We think it will be helpful for them and we are happy to take advantage of some of the competencies we've built with Prime Now with our fulfillment network so far.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Jefferies and Company.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC: Thanks, some questions on video. Any color such as engagement on the recent launch of video products in Japan including the Fire TV, the Fire TV stick and Prime Video? And also, any general updates on your video content strategy or view on standalone streaming separate from Prime? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, I will take that one, this is Brian. No specific call outs in Japan. I would say that we are still very bullish on our Prime Instant Video, especially our new original content we've created. We think it is been critically acclaimed and also a big hit with customers. Man in the High Castle is coming out shortly as is the second season of Transparent which won Emmys this year. So we are really excited about the creative team we've assembled and the products that they have been able to bring to Prime customers. And we still like the customer reaction. Free trial conversion rates are higher when Prime members stream and they also renew at a higher rate their annual subscription. So again, that's very important to us as well and are very happy with the results.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Macquarie Equities Research.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH EQUITIES: So Prime has done remarkably well with folks willing to pay $99 up front. But do you expect to have different offerings for different cohorts? In other words, right now, Prime is a one-size-fits-all model. Could we see different pricing models for different demographics in the future? And then separately, can you also talk about how shipping leverage changes during the holiday season when shoppers tend to want more items per transaction? Thanks.

PHIL HARDIN: Sure. So this is Phil. On the Prime pricing, we do have a few different programs for different demographics today with programs like Prime Student or Prime Family, which we're very excited about. I can't speculate as to what we'd do in the future but Prime is a program that is really important for us and we are working hard everyday to continue to build selection there and to continue to make Prime better.

Hopefully you see that in the list of things we've launched recently and the continued cadence of making the services we have better. We just added a lot of new music in our Prime Music program. And as Brian mentioned, some of the upcoming programming should be pretty good in the fall. The Man in the High Castle is actually our most watched pilot, so we are excited about that one as well. So, continue to work on Prime.

PHIL HARDIN: On the shipping side --

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: I would say it is difficult equation. Yes, order size can go up but we ship a lot of toys and bigger items so it is hard to predict what that looks like. But having the density, having the sort centers has certainly helped our cost structure in that area and having inventory closer to our customers.

OPERATOR: Stephen Ju, Credit Suisse.

STEPHEN JU, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks. Brian, it seems like you guys are rolling out Prime Now as well as product verticals internationally, fairly quickly especially if you measure it versus the pace of the rollout for Fresh or your other International older territories. Am I reading too much into this or have you guys put in place different processes to iterate more quickly?

And second, I think you've disclosed that as of the end of 2014, a little less than 10% of your fulfillment centers are outfitted with Kiva. So I guess, are all of your other fulfillment centers on a go forward basis going to have Kiva? If not, why not? And given the pickup in presumably the volume through-put there, does this mean you can slow down the pacing of your buildout there? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, sure. On Prime Now, it is our intent to rollout benefits and functionality globally as quickly as possible. I think we were able to do that with Prime Now and get to the UK faster. We are happy with that, it is not necessarily a comment on Amazon Fresh, it's just they are different businesses. So we're happy with the launch in the UK and the team did a great job to get that launch in a timely manner.

On Kiva, we are up to 30,000 bots at the end of Q3, which is -- and then they're in 13 for fulfillment centers. At the end of 2014, we had 15,000 bots. So we've doubled that amount and they were in 10 warehouses. Our intent is to use that more widely. And stay tuned.

OPERATOR: Ron Josey, JMP Securities.

RON JOSEY, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just real quickly on pay unit growth accelerated 26% this year. I realize that these are comps but anything significantly higher or anything that happened this quarter? I know Prime Day could be it, but wondering if that was the reason? And then on AWS usage, just wondering if you could update on usage? I believe last quarter you mentioned usage was growing faster than revenue. I wonder if that's the same case this quarter? Thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: So this is Phil. On the unit side, you did see units move in a rate that's highly correlated with revenue there. Keep in mind AWS and some of the other rental type offerings don't generate units so we don't count those. But we did see, certainly saw some additional units as result of Prime Day. And on a longer-term, bigger basis, the continued growth of Prime, the continued selection expansion is helping with the units growth there. Was there a second part of your question?

RON JOSEY: It was just on AWS unit growth. I think last quarter you said it was growing faster than revenue. I'm wondering if that's still the case here?

PHIL HARDIN: We continue to see really strong usage growth across the board and it's coming from customers of all sizes. We also have recently announced that Aurora, which is our new database software, is our fastest growing service ever. For a long time we talked about red shift and Aurora has now outpaced that. So we're very excited about what we are seeing there.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Cantor Fitzgerald.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Thank you very much. Two questions. First, with the courts striking down the Safe Harbor Provision between the US and the EU, how do you see the changes to European data storage requirement affecting AWS potentially? And on the Kiva, a question asked earlier, can you maybe help us understand the capital intensity of ace and actually using Kiva versus one that is not? Thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: This is Phil, I will take the Safe Harbor question with AWS. With our EU approved, AWS data protection agreement and model clauses we have in place, AWS customers can keep running their global operations using AWS and be in compliance with E-law. I think your second question was about the capital intensity? (Multiple speakers).

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Yes, right.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: I'm going to be vague on the scale of it but their capital intensity is offset by their density and throughput. So it is a bit of an investment that has implications for a lot of elements to your cost structure but we are very happy with Kiva. We think it is a great pairing our associates with Kiva robots to do some of the hauling of products within the warehouse has been a great innovation for us. And we think it makes the warehouse jobs better and I think it makes our warehouses more productive.

OPERATOR: John Blackledge, Cowen and Company.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great. Thanks. Two questions. So first, our data suggests that the US Prime sub growth is growing very rapidly at scale. Just wondering where you think the US Prime sub base is right now on the adoption curve? The second question is North American EGM growth accelerating again this quarter, we're assuming growth is being driven in part by categories like apparel and consumables versus perhaps a more mature category like electronics. So the questions are, with the vertical mix changing, how should we think about the impact to margins or are some of the newer and faster growing categories structurally higher margin for Amazon than the more mature categories? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, I cannot get into too much detail on the components of EGM profitability. I would say that we are seeing strong growth across all of our EGM categories. We have great teams that are chasing a lot of different product lines and working with vendors to get more selection on the site, both retail and also third-party. So still a lot of room there.

On the Prime sub growth, we are not updating the statistics. We are very happy with the growth not only in participation but also purchases and retention and we had a very successful Prime Day in July that we are really happy. It was a great event for customers and sellers. That's about all I have on that.

PHIL HARDIN: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Greetings. Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2015 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.

   TD
After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.

PHIL HARDIN, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello. And welcome to our Q2 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, July 23, 2015 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.

Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results.

Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion, up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.

Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.61 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

Return on invested capital was 17%, up from 6%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.

Combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 488 million shares, compared with 480 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 22%.

Worldwide active customer counts was approximately 285 million, excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12 month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 265 million, up from approximately 237 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide seller units represented 45% of paid units, up from 41% in the comparable prior year period.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.16 billion or 65.4% of revenue, compared with 69.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.95 billion or 29.9% of sales, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.74 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.8%. Tech and content was $2.70 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 10.4%. Marketing was $1.1 billion or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.7%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $13.8 billion. Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.99 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 80% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million, a 5.1% operating margin. Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%.

In the International segment, revenue increased 3% to $7.56 billion. Excluding the $1.37 billion year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 72% of International revenues.

International segment operating loss was $19 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.

In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue increased 81% to $1.82 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin. Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%. Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year.

Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 168%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $464 million compared to a loss of $15 million in the prior year period.

Our income tax expense was $266 million. GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $126 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $6.02 billion year-over-year to $14 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $7.47 billion, and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.1 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $12.39 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 71 in the prior year.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such a settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and if foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q3 2015, we expect net sales of between $23.3 billion and $25.5 billion, or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $480 million loss and $70 million of income, compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $580 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to a $136 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks, and with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.

PHIL HARDIN: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Our first question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is live.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thanks for taking my questions. Clearly a lot of things that were working well in the quarter, but maybe just focusing in on AWS which is -- seems to be quickly emerging as your largest contributor to operating income. Can you maybe provide a little more color on what drove the acceleration and just the overall growth in the business, if you could talk a little bit about the addition of new customers versus average spend per customer and I think in the past you've talked about what unit growth was for AWS?

And then in the press release you talked about expanding AWS into some new International markets. Can you give us a feel for how much of AWS's business today is domestic and what kind of opportunity you have there to expand AWS outside the US.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, Mark. Thanks for your question.

So we will not be providing the granular customer detail, unfortunately, but I will say the growth of 81% was up from 49% in Q1. You'll remember that we're lapping a number of large price decreases in Q2 of last year, so it was somewhat expected, but a very strong quarter in AWS. We did open a region in India

PHIL HARDIN: We've announced a region in India.

The other thing to mention is just we continue to see really strong usage growth. It's outpacing the revenue growth of 81%, obviously. And so we're really excited about it.

From a distribution of customers, it is a global business. We have regions spread throughout the world. We've got 11 regions at this point and have announced plans to launch a region in India in the future.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed. Your line is live.

ERIC SHERIDAN, ANALYST, UBS: Great. Thank you for taking the question. There's been some recent press reports talking about investments in India. Wanted to know, you've talked a little bit about that market in the past, whether there was any update there in terms of how you're thinking about approaching that market and the level of investments that might be needed to compete in the market. Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Certainly, Eric. What I could say about India is that when we say a positive surprise, we double down on it. That's kind of our policy. India is that kind of surprise.

We're very happy, very encouraged early on with what we've seen, the ramping of the business, the level of invention going on for both customers and sellers. We're over 25 million ASINs, which is the largest online store in India, and continue to improve pricing and fast delivery.

So we're super excited about India. I will not get into specific investment levels right now, but we continue to ramp up our investment there.

ERIC SHERIDAN: Thanks so much.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you. A couple questions. We follow this coming for a long time and profits seem to move around quite a bit year-over-year and year against year. Just wondering how you think about that? Is that just the nature of your big bets and that's just going to continue or is there a way to smooth that out?

And secondly, in AWS, it does seem like pricing competition has come down and we've been to a lot of your events and it seems like you're emphasizing pricing a little less to your customers. Can you talk at all about the pricing environment in cloud? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Let me start with that second question. So as Phil mentioned, we're seeing continued increases in usage, both sequentially and year-over-year. We're also seeing great efficiency in the business on a cost basis. Innovation is accelerating, not decelerating. We had over 350 significant new features and services and we believe that's what's resonates with customers.

Pricing is certainly a factor. We don't believe it's always the primary factor. In fact, what we hear from our customers is that the ability to move faster and more agilely is what they value.

I'm sorry, the first part of your question was?

JUSTIN POST: I was asking about just how the profitability really moves, pretty big swings year-over-year. Is that the nature of your just big bets and that can continue or is there a way to smooth that out going forward? How do you think about that?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Well, here's how I think about it. We have two things, at least two things going on. We're continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we're in. But we're also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace, Prime and AWS.

If you saw our shareholder letter this year, I think Jeff Bezos put it really well. He said we're going to look for things that are important to customers, customers love them, businesses that can grow to be a large size, that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades. We will continue to invest in the businesses that we think fit that profile, and we're always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that profile.

As far as lumpiness, admittedly it is lumpy and we will continue to work on both those tracks going forward.

JUSTIN POST: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Okay. Thanks. I don't know if Tom's listening in. That's a great exit on his part.

On International retail, you had nice acceleration there. Could you give us a little bit more of the why behind that? Why would international revenue growth, particularly in EGM, accelerate pretty materially? Is that the impact of the buildup of Prime in international markets, and also in the US, too, but more spend per Prime customer as they go through this evolution that's just layering on? Is that what it is? What is causing that acceleration? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Certainly. We saw good acceleration in both North America and international this quarter. North America was up 200 basis points sequentially and international was up 800 basis points. And half of that you'll remember we've spoken about the impact of the Japanese consumption tax that was instituted last April 1 of 2014.

It had a measurable impact on our run rate, our growth rate, last year, particularly in Q2. And so we're lapping that, which sequentially makes up half of the 800 basis point sequential gain. But independent of that, yes, you're right, Prime membership continues to grow.

Faster outside -- data we gave you at the end of the year, it's growing faster outside the US than it is in the US. We're happy with both growth rates, quite frankly. I would say the Prime membership to Prime Flywheel, the additional benefits we're adding to Prime, not only in North America but also internationally, and additional selection, both retail and FBA which feeds the Prime Flywheel.

MARK MAHANEY: Okay. Thanks a lot.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTL: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two.

The first one on the North America retail profitability was up nicely. Can you just talk to some of the drivers of that? Is it more top line and more Prime subs coming on, or is it more on the logistics side and what's driving the North America improving profitability?

And then the international profitability, is there any way you can help us understand the profitability of the more mature international markets like UK and Germany relative to the US at this point?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. So let me start with North America. 5.1% operating margin was up from 3.9% in Q1 and 3% last Q2. You hit a nail on the head. A lot of it is the top line growth, but it's also a lot of the efficiency we're seeing, particularly on the fulfillment and marketing lines, which for the whole Company were flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis.

So we are getting very good top line growth, a lot of that is fueled by Prime, Prime adoption, and we are dropping a lot of it to the bottom line with many of the efficiency projects. In international we had not split countries out. What I can say is that if you adjust for foreign exchange, the operating margin is up slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. What you're seeing there is obviously colored by our investment, our increased investment in India based on the momentum and success we've been seeing there so far.

BRIAN NOWAK: Okay. Great. Thanks.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two things I wanted to ask. First on Prime Day, Brian, if you could give a little more color there on the early take-aways that you have, and also more importantly how you think that sets Amazon up for the back-to-school season and also the holidays later in the year?

And then also can you just comment on the headcount, which I believe is up 18,000 or so sequentially, which I believe is the biggest number that you've ever added in a quarter? Is there anything in particular that stands out there or just more fulfillment centers, more geography expansion as well? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Let me start with that second question first. Yes, headcount was up 38% year-over-year. The vast majority of that is in operations where we're adding people for our new FCs and call centers. We continue to look for smart, innovative people who want to build on behalf of customers and so we are -- but this particular quarter is colored a bit by the operations growth.

If you look at Prime Day, we're thrilled with the results of Prime Day. Surpassed all of our expectations. Any metric we look at, we think it was a huge success. Customers saved millions. New Prime members signed up at higher rates than we've ever seen. People bought more devices than on any other day. So it's a great success.

My hat's off to the operations team and all the people who worked on that because it was a Christmas in July, quite frankly. Bigger day than Black Friday as we've said and orders increased 266% year-over-year. I'll also point out that worldwide FBA unit order growth approached 300%. Not only was it a great day for Amazon, it was also a great day for our sellers, which was great. So while not breaking out the impact of Prime Day specifically, it's incorporated into our guidance.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, BERNSTEIN: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. I may be delusional, but if I add your capital leases and CapEx that suggests that AWS capital (inaudible) is at least 80% if not much higher. What gives you confidence that if AWS continues to grow so fast and consuming so much capital, two years out you'll be able to fund its growth from the retail business? And secondly, can you help me understand why you are not rolling out Prime Now and Fresh faster? What specifically are the bottlenecks there? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Let me start with that second one. Prime Now you said and Amazon Fresh. We are moving very quickly on Prime Now. We've now expanded to nine cities, three more in the quarter, including our first international city in London. So we're moving quick. But we would always like to move quicker, obviously.

On AWS, I think your question's more around the ability to fund AWS. No comments specifically on that. We do realize it's a capital intensive business and we have modeling that shows that it's going to be a very -- it is a very good business for us and that's what we aim for is long-term return on invested capital and free cash flow.

So we're certainly cognizant of the capital part of that calculation. So not much more I can add on that, Carlos.

CARLOS KIRJNER: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great. Thanks, guys. Wondering if you can touch a little bit more on AWS margins? Is there a level, particularly when you've been able to maintain pricing strength the way that you have been, where you feel like margins start to become and the leverage that you have there starts to become a catalyst for lowering prices or is that purely a competitive decision? And as you think about AWS longer term, is there a framework or structure that you use to think about where margins in that business should be?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Thanks for your question, Heath. Yes, I'll point out that we have continued to lower prices. We've had multiple price cuts this year. We're now up to 49 since launch in 2006. So it is a fundamental part of our business model. So is innovation. And as I said, we have over 350 new features and services that have also significant features and services that have launched this year.

As we were just talking with Carlos, the capital investment is very large as well. So we continue to fund it and we're super excited with customer reception that we're getting and the feedback we get from large customers and so we're thrilled with the business and price reductions are part of that model. And again, as I said earlier, we're in the long haul, in this for the long haul. We are looking for return on invested capital, free cash flow and happy customers in this space.

HEATH TERRY: Great. Thanks. Really appreciate it.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Thank you. I guess another question on AWS, if I may? So want to go back to something that you said, Brian. You said that you've seen greater efficiency in that business from a cost standpoint. I was wondering if you could maybe parse that out a little more for us? Were you referring to OpEx or CapEx?

And if you're referring to CapEx as well, have you -- do you feel that you've reached that escape velocity that should allow CapEx as a percentage of revenues, pricing aside, to now allow you for constant decline in that metric? CapEx as a percentage of revenue for that particular business? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, what I can tell you is we have seen great efficiency on the cost side. The cost to generate the capacity for AWS. I'll also say that Amazon is one of the primary large customers of AWS, so we see it on the consumer side of the business as well, although that's not included in AWS revenue. It's in intercompany relationship. So we get a double whammy there. We're getting great efficiency from our external AWS business, but also from our own use of AWS services.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Okay. Thanks.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.

RON JOSEY, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick follow-up on Heath's question on the price reductions, Brian, you said earlier in the year. Can you just compare maybe the reductions earlier this year, versus the ones across the board from last year and 2Q 2014?

And a follow-up just on the third party units. I think you mentioned third party units are now 45% or maybe 47% of total units. Is there a natural limit there or does it matter as long as the customer experience through FBA is seamless. Thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: I'll comment on the units first. We're really following the model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first party or third party. I think we're working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform. Brian touched on the success that our FBA sellers had with Prime Day. We see FBA as a tailwind for the third party business in general.

When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014 about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program. So we're really happy with what that's doing for third party business. We're working really hard to give customers as many option as possible and allowing them to choose. We don't really have a specific target there. It all comes down to customer choice.

On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving cost out of the business. And you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS. We've also lowered prices for customers 49 times since launch and so it can be lumpy but over the long haul that's the model we followed.

RON JOSEY: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question is from Paul Vogel with Barclays Capital.

PAUL VOGEL, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Great. Thank you. Just a question on the content side. Any update on how engaged folks are, the video side of Prime, and their shopping behavior number one? Number two, any update on your plans for growth on the content cost side? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. On the engagement of Prime customers, excuse me, PIV customers, we've seen buying habits that look like normal Prime customers or other Prime customers from the group that comes in through the digital pipelines. We also see a higher pick-up in retention rates and free trial conversions. So we're very happy with the linkage between our digital offerings and the Prime customer base.

On the content side, I will say that one of the factors in the sequential guidance, Q2 to Q3 being lower is two things. What we're talking about is the fulfillment center, additional fulfillment center cost we see this time every year as we get ready for Q4, but also additional step-up in content spend where we spend a lot of our content in Q3. You'll see extensions of a lot of the successful shows that we've had so far this year, a new pilot season including Man in the High Castle and Hand of God, so stay tuned for that.

PHIL HARDIN: Or seasons of Man in the High Castle and Hand of God.

PAUL VOGEL: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: Good afternoon and congratulations. Just want to follow up on a previous question. In past calls you talked about an increased focus on productivity. Is that still a focus of yours? And separately, any thoughts in terms of how robotics are impacting, any updates in terms of number of robots in fulfillment centers? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Thanks for your questions, Gene. On robotics first, we don't have any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the progress of that business. We had very high expectations for Amazon robotics and its impact on our warehouse cost structure and we've been very pleasantly surprised by the job being done by that team. That's looking great.

Efficiency, yes, as we talked about in the last few calls we have more emphasis on variable and fixed productivity. I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen. To give you a little more color on that, I would say what does that look like. Defect reduction and process improvements are probably something we've always done and worked on, both to lower our cost but also improve the customer experience and also the seller and vendor experience.

We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people which we think is more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into those decisions. As I said earlier, we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business as on the Amazon side as well. We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and throughput of the fulfillment centers and just generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand warehouses and the sort centers that we added primarily last year. All have helped our cost structure.

So just a little more color on maybe some specifics on the efficiency area.

GENE MUNSTER: Great. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jeffries & Company.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC: Great. Thanks. You now halfway through 2015, any update or insights on your fulfillment center buildout plans for the year? If you can't disclose that, can you maybe just give us a general sense of focus and strategy, how should we be thinking about domestic versus international, as well as sortation versus traditional? What's kind of the path to build out over the next 6, 12, 18 months? Thanks.

PHIL HARDIN: Sure. So we ended the year last year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and 19 US sort centers. Typically, we're looking at what the demand would be for peak as we figure out what we need. Still a little early in the year to comment on that.

In the past we've given an update sometime around Q3 on that. Continuing to build as we have demand and like, Brian said, we like to be close to customers and benefit from having inventory close to customers as well. So like I said, a little early for the update at this point, but something that we're looking at and something the team's working really hard on.

BRIAN PITZ: Great. Thanks.

OPERATOR: Our next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird equity research.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: Thanks. Congrats on the great quarter. In the retail business obviously a lot of variables driving growth there. You're seeing higher Prime membership levels for one, but I wonder how much of that growth you can also break down by some other factors, for example, we're seeing a notable increase in selection across longer-tail categories?

And then secondly, in the press release no mention of Fire phone. I think almost every other product was mentioned. Can we just chalk that one up now to a learning experience and an example of where Amazon is showing some discipline around investments, or how should we think about that? Thanks.

PHIL HARDIN: So I'll start with the Fire phone question. We have a policy of not commenting on our roadmap, so can't give you anything there. We obviously do learn from everything we do and value the feedback we get from customers. But nothing to share at this point.

In terms of growth, we continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth. Prime is obviously very important as well. We really haven't teased those apart. FBA becomes very important as well. We've talked about some of the tailwinds we see there and sort of the linkage between Marketplace and Prime that FBA provides.

All those things are going on. As you see in EGM, strength across a lot of the categories there. There was no single category we're really calling out, but continue to see good selection growth and good Prime growth as well.

COLIN SEBASTIAN: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks, guys. So Brian, I know you guys don't like to provide guidance beyond the next quarter, but philosophically if we go back a few quarters, you've characterized 2015 as a year where you believe that some of the heavier investments made in prior years should start to benefit and pay off and we're clearly seeing that in AWS and in North America retail. And it looks like you're still investing heavily on international retail.

If we look out 2016, 2017, is there any high level philosophical commentary about whether you see next year as another year of these types of trends that you're seeing now, or are there any bigger investment areas, particularly in the retail business that you might be looking to take advantage of?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Thanks for your question. I can't forecast into the future on that, but I will reiterate the investments we have going on right now, which, again, we're looking to invest to strengthen the Prime platform. That includes video content, including Amazon Originals, Prime Music, Prime Now, we have a robust device business, including a launch of a new Paperwhite Fire TV Echo with general availability and numerous other products that we're very excited about. That roadmap, we know those devices drive customer engagement and sales. We build fulfillment centers so we can add selection and we can add FBA partners and then we add things like same day delivery which we talked about.

On the AWS side, we continue to invest in that infrastructure. We talked about opening -- announcing the region in India, so there's expansion there's as well. Feature expansion, services expansion, internationally, very similar to the US on a number of the Prime fronts, but also the investment in India.

And then a few other things you may have seen in our press release today. The launch of Mexico, which we're very excited about, and Amazon Business, so lots of -- as I said, lots of investment in front of us but we operate in two paths. We're definitely working for operational efficiencies in the business that we're in. We're investing wisely in things that we think are big and important. And it's not a static activity.

We continue to evaluate those investments, take into account what customer response is and make changes. So I think you can look forward to continuation of that into the future.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.

KERRY RICE, ANALYST, NEEDHAM & COMPANY: Thanks a lot. You've talked a lot about operational efficiencies. I know you guys have partnered with the post office and deliveries.

Can you talk a little bit about how that is potentially benefiting and maybe the longer term strategy with the post office? And then you guys haven't necessarily broken this out, but I think you do generate a fair amount of revenue from advertising. I think that's in the other category. Is there anything that you can provide on advertising revenue? Thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: Sure. So I'll start with the first part of that question. We definitely are delivering a lot of packages with the post office. I think most notably they did a lot of the Sunday delivery that you saw when we started launching Sunday delivery.

We try lots of things for fulfillment. We're constantly working to provide the best experience to customers and be as efficient as possible. And so we're happy with all the partners we have and continue to work with them to provide the best experience possible.

For advertising, I would remind you that certain parts of the advertising roll up into other. Some actually roll up to EGM and media as well. So it's a business we're really excited about. We're taking a customer-centric approach as we build that to make sure we're providing engaging business, engaging ads to customers and making sure we keep the customer front of mind.

It's a business that the team is excited about and working hard on.

KERRY RICE: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.

STEPHEN JU, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks. Brian, just a follow up on the India question earlier. To my knowledge, foreign e-commerce operators such as yourself are not allowed to have first party retail operations. But given the fulfillment enhanced customer service has always been a high focus item for you guys, what steps have you taken in the country to make sure that the consumer experience there is as good if not better for the inventory on which you have no direct control?

And secondarily, similar to China you have a pretty large population base and internet penetration currently that's probably comparable to what was the case when you acquired Joyo. Can you provide any color on how the general operating environments are the same or different, and do you expect your growth trajectory there to be similar to what you saw in China? Thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: Your first question was about the infrastructure and how we're managing the customer experience in India. So FBA, Easy Ship and some of those programs are important to us. They're very valuable for sellers to make it easy for the seller to get their goods to the customer. They're great from a customer experience standpoint because we can do what we do best with the logistics. And so there is a lot of investment, a lot of efforts going on in that front.

I would say that India and China are totally different and I think, as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we've seen there so far. And so very happy with the trajectory we're on there and excited to be investing and have the opportunities we do at that point.

STEPHEN JU: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great. Thank you. So it appears that Amazon is growing its share of household budget driven by many factors, Prime growth and strong growth in large verticals like apparel among others. Specifically on apparel, just wondering how you view the breadth of Amazon's apparel offering? Any color on that segment's performance in the second quarter and how do you view Amazon's apparel opportunity going forward? Thank you.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, thanks for your question. We have not broken out specifically apparel, but we're super excited about that business. It's growing very well. We like our position in it. We think our website is very, very atune to selling online. So we're very happy with that.

It is a big business for us, not only in North America but also Internationally. So you mentioned a couple other consumables categories. I will say we are very happy in our consumables and hard line categories as well. We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and subscribe and Save and others. So very happy with the EGM business as a whole.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE: Thanks.

OPERATOR: Our final question comes from Scott Tilghman with B. Riley.

SCOTT TILGHMAN, ANALYST, B. RILEY CARIS: Thanks. Wanted to just follow up on a couple things. Three quick questions.

First off on international, I was wondering if you could compare and contrast relative performance of media and EGM, moving in different directions? Second, there have been a couple questions about shipping, but most notable is that we had a couple price increases from the majors hit at the beginning of the year and it seems like your costs are coming down. I was wondering if you could comment on that?

And then third just following up on Brian's question around the FCs. I was wondering how many of the facilities lend themselves to expansion rather than having to put up a new facility. Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. Let me start with the first question on international media and EGM. I think we're seeing similar trends in both geographies, both segments that EGM growth is much -- is very strong. Media growth has been consistent for the last four quarters. We do like the work being done by the media teams.

There's a lot of pipeline of invention, things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music, all feed the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will. They work great with our devices, by the way. And they drive other non-media sales. So they're very tied together, although certainly the EGM is outpacing the media segment or excuse me, media businesses right now.

On transportation costs, not a lot to add there. Again, we are -- we have a combination of doing our own shipping and using third party carriers. So the rate increases are staged and we see those quite frequently, nothing to add there.

On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think we're looking to always to get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have. And as we need new facilities, we place them closer and closer to customers. So that can have its benefits as well. Not much more to add on that one.

PHIL HARDIN: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Greetings. Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2015 financial results teleconference.

   TD
(Operator Instructions)

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to do the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.

PHIL HARDIN, DIRECTOR OF INVESTOR RELATIONS, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2015 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO; and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 23, 2015, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could be potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including the most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. In addition, the release includes historical financial results of our North America, International, and Amazon Web Services reportable segments for 2014 and 2013.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY, VICE PRESIDENT & CFO, GLOBAL CONSUMER BUSINESS., AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our first-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 47%, to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion.

In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash, and through capital and finance leases. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.68 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations.

Return on invested capital was 14%, up from 9%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by averaged total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares, compared with 476 million one year ago.

Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72 billion, or 22%, excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%.

Active customer accounts was approximately $278 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 260 million, up from approximately 230 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 44% of paid units.

Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.4 billion, or 67.8% of revenue, compared with 71.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A, combined was $6.62 billion, or 29.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $2.67 billion, or 11.7% of revenue, compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $2.52 billion, or 11.1% of revenue, compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $1.05 billion, or 4.6% of revenue, compared with 4.3%.

Now, I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International, and Amazon Web Services. In addition, we have provided historical results for these segments, for 2014 and 2013, with our earnings release filing today. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments, our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, representing 76% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 79% to $517 million, a 3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 77%.

In the International segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.32 billion, or increased 2%, excluding foreign exchange.

EGM revenue grew 4% to $5.38 billion, or 21%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 69% of international revenues. International segment operating loss was $76 million, compared to a loss of $33 million in the prior-year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange to International segment operating loss was $78 million.

In the Amazon Web Services segment revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 8% to $265 million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income decreased 13%.

Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to $706 million, or 3.1% of revenue, up approximately 60 basis points year over year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 45%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 million compared to $146 million in the prior-year period.

Our income tax expense was $71 million. GAAP net loss was $57 million, or negative $0.12 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $108 million and $0.23 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $5.12 billion year over year to $13.78 billion. Inventory increased 10% to $7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8. Down from 9.1 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 13% to $11.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe, today, to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates, can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q2 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion for growth of between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and a positive $50 million of income, compared to a $15 million loss in second quarter 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $100 million and $650 million, compared to $404 million in the second quarter of 2014. We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks, and with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.

PHIL HARDIN: Great. Thanks, Brian. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: Thank you.

(Operator Instructions)

One moment while we poll for questions. Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed. Your line is live.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Thank you. Can you share with us any updated metrics for Prime Now? How sticky is it in terms of repeat customers, average order value, or other details?

And, also any update on your fulfillment center plans for the year? If you can't disclose specific numbers, maybe you could just qualitatively tell us your focus, either domestic versus international? Or, sortation versus traditional FC build out? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Sure. On Prime Now, we're -- don't have specific metrics we want to share today. But, we have expanded to seven cities, with more on the way. Customers are really enjoying the one hour and two hour delivery of tens of thousands of daily essential products. So, the response has been great.

We'll point out that our operations network that we've been building for the last 20 years, helps make Prime Now a viable proposition for us. The scale makes a possible. So, really, so far customer response has been great.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP & CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: And, Brian, on the FCs, as we've done in prior years, it's early in the year, and as we progress through the year, we'll give you some updates on how many. But, as a reminder, we ended the year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and we'll update you as we go.

OPERATOR: Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Great. Thanks for the new disclosure, guys. Really really helpful. I guess just digging in on that a little bit, we all understand the investments you guys are making on international retail. And, maybe why that margin's been declining.

But, can you give us some color on what's driving up the North America retail segment margin. And, I guess in the context of that, just talk about the impact that Prime is having on the retail margin for both North America and International. Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, sure. So, North America operating margin up 120 basis points year over year to 3.9%. A lot of good cost efficiency. But, again, we're continuing to invest selectively as we build the Prime platform and invent on behalf of customers.

So, you'll see a lot of invention. Definitely to feed the Prime platform, which, things like video content, Prime music as we talk about Prime Now devices. And, we continue to build fulfillment centers for selection and expansion and FBA. So, that's -- it's generally what's driving the operating margin in North America.

TOM SZKUTAK: And, just to add onto that, we're -- we gave the metrics last quarter about Prime. It's growing very fast. As Brian said, we're feeding the platform and certainly, the common thing with category expansion, new FCs, original content, Prime Instant Video devices, Prime Now; the common theme is they're all really intertwined with Prime.

And, they're inextricably linked to our consumer business in Prime. So, it's just -- we're happy to do it. And, the last quarter, we gave an indication of the growth rates after being added for 10 years. So, we're super excited to have the platform and to continue to invest in it.

ROSS SANDLER: Great. Thanks, guys.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking the question. Could you guys talk a little bit more, just about the international business and, kind of, the key initiatives here in terms of getting the growth to reaccelerate from these levels?

And, then also perhaps, a little bit more on your strategy in China? How you're thinking about the cost structure there, relative to previous years? And, some of the key ways you might be able to rationalize things there? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, let me start with China. So, I think you see a lot of invention. You're seeing a lot of invention from us in China right now. Amazon is a trusted source of authentic international products.

And, that's really what we're doubling down on now, with the Amazon global store on our own site, which gives Chinese customers access to over a million Amazon products globally. And then, the team all flagship store for international brands, which you've heard about. Giving thousands of direct imported products access, or, customers, access to these products. And those happened to be stocked and ready to ship from our fulfillment centers in China. So, that's an added benefit.

25% of those are exclus -- or, over 25% of those are exclusives to Amazon. So, we continue to be selective in our investments there. But, we're taking the long-term view and we have hopes for the new initiatives along with the global store and the team all flagship store.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the growth for total international, just maybe, some comments first about the current quarter. And, then elaborate a little bit further. But, the growth was down 2% on a dollar basis. Up 14% on a local currency basis.

So, we did see a little bit of improvement in terms of growth rate acceleration versus the last couple quarters. And, in addition to the things that Brian mentioned earlier, about the Prime platform. That's something that we're doing globally. And so, we're certainly, all of those things we're working on globally. So, those are things that, at least in most geographies, we have today.

One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at the growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1 we talked about in April 1, there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. We had some, what we think some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that. And, in Q1 of this year. So, it's a headwind if you think about it for Q1. But, we're looking at -- we think there's still a big opportunity.

As we mentioned last call, a big opportunity with Prime. Prime's growing at a faster rate. We think there's still a great opportunity to add unique selection to -- for category expansion. And, again, so we're going to continue to feed the Prime platform as we talked about. Continue to add selection in a lot of categories.

We're also very excited about India. If you take a look at our results for -- from an operating profit standpoint, you see that it was approximately negative $76 million on a dollar basis. If you back out exchange, that's approximately breakeven. Included in there, we certainly have a sizable step up in investment in India. And, we're super excited from what we see there right now.

We think it's very big opportunity. And, we're investing appropriately for that big opportunity. So, those are some of the things that we're working on. And, we think they're -- we still have a lot of opportunity there moving forward.

OPERATOR: Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the new AWS disclosure.

Can you just help us on accounting question. The AWS data center costs related to the core e-commerce business. Are those being allocated to North America and International? Or, are those being fully embedded into the AWS segment?

And then, the second question goes back to China, I guess. Any early learnings from the team all partnership and whether you have new thoughts of, potentially, a lower capital intensive growth strategy in China?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: To answer your first question, yes, they are. The associated infrastructure costs to run our North America and International consumer business, those costs, those infrastructure costs are being allocated to those segments.

The second question, in terms of China, it's early. We're liking, certainly, some of the things that we're seeing there. But, there's not a lot I can add to that at this stage.

BRIAN NOWAK: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: Great thanks. Maybe, just another follow up on the new segment disclosure. Thanks for breaking that out.

If we assume that the advertising other segment is reasonably profitable, than the implication is then that the core retail business is very modestly profitable, close to breakeven. And, just wondering what the thought process is and strategy is behind that? If in a sense, there's some subsidy to the retail side being used as you build market share in the core business? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, I think the best way to think about it is, we certainly have an advertising part of our North American consumer segments. But, the way you should think about it is we are making some great investments for the long term. And, that's really what's reflected in the operating results that you're seeing in terms of -- so, it is certainly impacting the operating margins both for North America and International.

So, it's the things that we're -- both Brian and I talked about, that we're doing globally to support the Prime platform. All of those things that we mentioned. Video content, original content, Prime Now, category expansion, investing on behalf of FBA, which also helps Prime devices. Those are all intertwined and certainly part of that.

And, then some of the things outside of -- that are more specifically related to International in addition to those, are some of the geographic stuff that we talked about. So, I think you should think about it that way. That, certainly we think it's a big opportunity.

And, again, one of the reasons I wanted to give you an update last quarter on Prime growth and you can see that that's going very well, and so we're feeding that. And, that's what we have been doing and that's what you see also, in certainly, the results that you're seeing today.

COLIN SEBASTIAN: All right, helpful. Thanks very much.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure.

OPERATOR: Mark May with Citi.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thanks for taking my questions. On the International revenue, I believe there's probably a -- there's a real distinction here between some of your more established countries and some of your more emerging countries.

I wonder if you could talk a little bit about, for Germany and the UK and Japan and some of the more established markets. What the profit profile of those markets look like? And, just how much of the International segment results are being -- losses being held back by a handful of the more emerging markets?

And, then a question on AWS pricing. That seemed like the pricing environment was pretty competitive last year. What are you seeing in the market this year and what your expectations going forward? Are you expecting a bit more of a stable pricing environment? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, in terms of International, we're not breaking out individual country results. The one thing that I did mention around from a country perspective, was India. In terms of, we've certainly stepped up our investment. And, if you look at it year over year. So, that's certainly reflected in the numbers that you're seeing.

In terms of AWS, we've had 48 price decreases since inception. The team is doing a terrific job in terms of working on behalf of customers to pass on savings as they see it. But, in terms of any comment on what to expect going forward, there's really not much to add there.

PHIL HARDIN: It probably is worth adding, that although price is a factor, the primary factor for customers choosing to move to AWS is really around their ability to move quickly and to be nimble and agile.

And so, we're very pleased with the kind of continued adoption and usage growth we've seen and obviously the benefits of AWS around their ability, customers' ability to be nimble, as a primary factor there.

OPERATOR: Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. My first is, my first question is about the profitability of the North America segment. You mentioned a few moments ago, that investments in Prime were part of the, or, may -- most of the explanation for what is a relatively low 3.9% margin in North America. Which, are much lower than the 5 to 6% margin EBIT margin that the brick-and-mortar retailer books. Despite, a large benefit of booking 3P net.

Here's the question. Prime is not new in North America. You probably have tens of millions of Prime users in the US, now 30, 40, 50 million. Yet, margins are still low. What gives you confidence that the investments that you are making will pay off?

Second question on AWS. As you look at expenses like R&D, and perhaps, even the fixed component of marketing and sales, which presumably, one day will be really fixed. Are they still growing significantly?

In other words, is there room for significant margin expansion at some point in the future when AWS is, I don't know, three, five, or ten times its current size? Or, do you expect R&D to scale up at the same rate as revenues? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of your first question specifically related to North America. One of the comments we made last quarter, that we disclosed, was we disclosed the growth rate globally. As well as the growth rate in the US. And, the growth rate in the US after 10 years is up 50%. It was up 50% year over year.

And so, 2014 versus 2013, in terms of Prime membership. And, that's after a price increase on Prime from 79 to 99. So, it gives you a feel for the work that we've put into Prime to make that experience great for customers and the value that we're giving them. So again, given that growth.

So, that's what, that's certainly one of the things that gives us comfort. But, when we look at the individual pieces we like what we see. So, in other words, some of the investments we're making, I think as we've talked about the past. I'll give one example, would be, video content, both original and licensed content.

We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers. And, what we've seen to date, is it's certainly still an investment for us. It's certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see. We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline, if you will, for video content. They convert at a higher rate.

We see -- we have a great retention of Prime members. But, those who stream, actually, we retain those at a higher rate. And, we bring in new customers through our video pipeline. The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipelines. So, in other words, they're buying very good from a physical product standpoint, as well as digital. So, they're buying a diverse set of products.

So, in other words, the video content that we're spending is helping us. Customers will buy consumables from us. They'll buy clothing from us. They'll buy shoes from us. They'll buy electronics. They'll buy media items.

So, that's what we're seeing and so again, it's some of these things are very early. We'll have to see over time how efficient they are. But, each period we go, we keep the data that we see, we're encouraged. And so, that's just one example.

But, that's why we are investing a lot in Prime and we think it's a great -- the Prime platform, if you will. And, we think it's a great opportunity and as I mentioned earlier, all these things we're investing in are very intertwined.

PHIL HARDIN: And, Carlos, I think you had a question about AWS. From our perspective, it's a business that's still really in day one. A lot of potential innovation in front of us, we believe. And so, you can see we're putting a lot of CapEx, obviously there, including capital leases. And, we think over time, we will be able to generate significant free cash flow at strong ROICs.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks. I want to go back at this North America retail margins. And, I guess I want to try to figure out. I know you're not going to go out where they could go.

But, if we look in the past. I assume that if the base in 2014 and in full year 2013 was probably depressed for North American retail margins, North American segment margins. And, if we look back, five, six years, it's probable that that was running at, kind of, mid to high single digits, CSOI margins. Kind of similar to the incremental margins you just reported for that segment, 8.7%.

So, I guess the big question I want to ask is, is there a structural change in the North American retail business over the next -- this year and the next couple years? Versus what you had, call it in 2004 to 2009, when the margins were pretty clearly higher? And now, you're going to be recovering to the levels?

That's what I'm trying to get at. Any color would be great. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: The -- thanks for the question, Mark. Just in terms of going forward, we're not giving any specific guidance beyond the current quarter. So, I can't predict for you what could happen.

But, what you mentioned is, in some of the periods that you were describing, as you mentioned, what our business look like. Several years ago, when Prime was nascent or, and we were a bit earlier in the business. We go through different cycles. We're certainly still investing very heavily.

That being said, we, as I mentioned last quarter, we're spending time on making sure that we get productivity. So, we're working on both investing heavily in the business, while working on fixed and variable productivity in other areas. Putting a lot more energy into it. That's what's helping us with the improvement that Brian mentioned in terms of operating margins year over year. It's a number of different aspects, but certainly, a mix of business and some productivity is certainly impacting that.

But, again, we think this opportunity is to improve margins over time. You'll have to stay tuned on that to see what it looks like. But, we certainly, as you can see from, not only the results, but some of the data points that we've given over the last several quarters. We are investing heavily in the business again.

Because, we like what we see and the -- and Prime growing so dramatically globally after being in it for a long time. And, we think that that's a great platform to feed.

MARK MAHANEY: Okay. Thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Hello, a couple questions on margins. First on AWS, I think those are higher than most of us were thinking. Appreciate the disclosure.

What is driving your margin versus your pricing decision? How do you think about passing through cost efficiencies or potential margin growth through to customers?

And then, secondly, on international margins. Clearly, below history, below the US, what kind of things need to happen to get those at least to where the US is today? Much less, back to where they were six or seven years ago? Thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: Justin, I will take the AWS portion on the question first. So, our model over the long term really has been to innovate and to use our scale and position to be able to pass savings along to customers. And so, we've had 48 price decreases since we launched.

As I talked about earlier, that's one factor. Customers save a lot of money, but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables and the ability for developers to move really quickly.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the International. Again, as you mentioned, Justin, we are investing a lot right now. At which, impacts the margins there. Again, X exchange.

Think of it as approximately breakeven for the quarter. And so, again we're continuing to invest. We're investing in all the things that we talked about related to the platform. We continue to invest in some emerging geographies. Most notably certainly, India, with the step up given the experience we have.

So, we are optimistic over time. We have a lot to do there. We think it's a great opportunity for us and so that's what we're doing. But, we're excited about the opportunity and that's why you see the results that you're seeing there.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the run rate of CapEx and capital lease obligations in the quarter as any sort of indication for full year? And, the trajectory of investment in fulfillment and data centers?

And then, just on the question of Prime and Prime video. As we think about the way that media growth is trending now, is there a point where you start to think of allocating Prime, some of those Prime revenues to media to account for the -- as Prime video usage increases?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, in terms of the CapEx question. You know there's certainly two pieces of that. There's the consumer, the North America and International piece.

There's a number of pieces, but certainly the two largest pieces would certainly be the CapEx associated with fulfillment and the second would be infrastructure. And, again, that's for AWS versus North America and International.

I'll take the North America and International first. We're seeing good growth and year over year, in terms of overall unit growth, in terms of revenue growth, certainly, X exchange. As I a mentioned earlier, it's early in the year. So, as we do every year, we'll continue to monitor the growth there.

We're making plans for the rest of the year. And we'll get back to you as we progress throughout the year in terms of what fulfillment capacity we'll need to support that growth this year.

In terms of web services, it's obviously growing extremely fast. We saw some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective over the last few quarters here. Usage is growing faster than that, so we will be deploying more capital as we go there. In terms of the amounts, specific amounts, we're not giving guidance on that today.

And, one of the reasons is, it's just growing so fast, that we want to make sure we've put the right amount of capital in place and the team's doing a great job doing a lot of planning and the execution around that. So, that's what we're doing there. In terms of media, I'm not fully sure I understood the question. But, as it relates to, I think it's video, could you repeat the -- part of that, part of the question?

HEATH TERRY: Right, was just getting a sense of, as video becomes such a, becomes a bigger part of the Prime value proposition. Do you start to allocate some of the annual revenues from Prime more directly into that media segment? Because of the level of usage associated with Prime video versus the shipping benefits of Prime?

PHIL HARDIN: Heath, we do allocate some Prime to account for the video.

HEATH TERRY: Okay. Great. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks for the question.

OPERATOR: Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: Good afternoon, could you talk a little bit about the focus on same day and same hour? And specifically, about the incremental investments? And, just some context to how big of those investments are?

And, separately is what the strategic advantage is? Is this something, ultimately, obviously, it's to improve the experience, but do you see in any of your data that this opens you up to be more competitive with traditional retailers? Thanks.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, I'll take that one. We certainly, as I said earlier, we see this as a natural extension of our existing infrastructure investment. We've -- we have 109 fulfillment centers, again, very close to customers. It allows us and unlocks for us, same day and next day deliveries.

And, to its, extreme one hour and two hour deliveries, as you've seen with Prime Now. So, we're not forecasting or giving much more on that. But, we definitely see it as a valuable customer proposition and customers embraced it.

Again, a smaller number of ASINs, tens of thousands of ASINs, but available for one or two hour delivery. And, generally, in the category of essential products that you would need in a short time period.

TOM SZKUTAK: And, the only thing I would add to that, as Brian mentioned earlier as well, we're in seven cities today and they'll be more to come. We haven't said how many, but, you should be definitely expecting more to come, and we're very excited to do that.

OPERATOR: Robert Peck with SunTrust Robinson.

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY: Yes, thank you. I was wondering, Tom, could you give us an update on your retail store strategy? Should we expect stores to open up across the US or is that something you're just limited to trying out New York. And then number two, India's come up a couple of times on the call today.

China had several structural challenges based on the market there. I was curious if you could differentiate what you're seeing that's different in India versus the China challenges? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, in terms of our consumer business, we love the business that we have today. We love -- we think there's a great opportunity to do that. To continue to expand the existing business that we have.

In terms of other things, we have a longstanding practice of not talking about what we might or might not do there. In terms of the second part, India and China, could you repeat that part? Sorry.

ROBERT PECK: Sure, so you've talked about India a couple of times today on the call. Obviously it's big area of investment and focus for the Company. China had some structural challenges based on how the marketplace is.

I was wondering if you could differentiate what you're seeing in India that makes you optimistic there versus some of the challenges you faced in China?

BRIAN OLSAVSKY: Yes, thank you for the question. Yes, they are very different. You'll see the growth rate in India's very rapid. We talked about last year and it's increasing our investment.

I think the biggest difference is the focus on sellers and the connection of sellers. A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers all across India to succeed and grow their online businesses. You'll see from our press release, that we've launched some new apps for that. So, that helps them manage their inventory better and also respond to customer inquiries.

So, that's probably the biggest difference that we see between India and China. But, it's still very very early on in India.

OPERATOR: Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.

JASON HELFSTEIN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER & CO.: Thanks. So, can you talk about how the impact on available third-party SKUs impacts the business particular to in Europe?

And, ultimately what you could do to drive more SKUs through the platform? Whether it's lowering third-party rates or is it -- are there are other factors to try to get more SKUs on there for third-party? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: We've spent a tremendous amount of time on our seller business over the years. And, trying to improve both the experience for sellers as well as customers. And, we've done a lot of interesting things to help sellers and that's why you see the results that we're seeing today. 44% of our units today, as of this quarter, are third-party units. That's up about 400 basis points from last year.

Certainly, one of the things that we've talked about that's most -- that's notable, is fulfillment by Amazon. And so, the benefit for sellers is they get to take advantage of our multi-node fulfillment network globally. We have 109 fulfillment centers globally. As well as our customers get to take advantage of that as Prime members where we offer it in those geographies. So, it's really a great benefit for sellers.

It's good for sellers. It's good for customers. And, we believe good for shareowners too. Again, we're very excited. A number of different things we're working on. But certainly, one of the drivers, along with all the things that I mentioned is certainly FBA is very helpful.

OPERATOR: Mark Miller with William Blair & Company.

MARK MILLER, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY: Hi, good afternoon. Looking at the service sales, less the AWS revenues, you've got about $4 billion in fees mostly coming from the marketplace off a strong mid-30%.

Can you help us think about the costs that go against those marketplace fees? And, specifically within fulfillment, if you could help us understand how much of the cost is going against 3P, or basically, FBA fulfillment? Perhaps, percent of units out of the FCs that are going to 3P?

PHIL HARDIN: So, Mark, I can't comment on the derived number. But, I can say that FBA continues to grow really well. It's become a bigger and bigger part of our third-party mix over the years.

I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third-party units. Obviously, in the fulfillment line there is cost associated with that. As well as our other third-party units as well, with things like payment processing and other costs that we incur. So, I don't know if there's much more that we can say about that.

MARK MILLER: If I can insert a second question. Given the upside and profitability in the first quarter, the guidance for the second quarter quite a bit lower. What are the factors you see that are negatives? Or, I guess otherwise, people are going to think you are sand bagging. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, if you take a look at the guidance that we gave. Again, we gave as we have in previous quarters, we give a wide range. And, from a consolidated segment operating income standpoint, we gave $100 to $650.

The implied margin at the lower end, the higher end, is approximately 50 basis points upwards to 2.9%. This quarter, in Q1, we were up 60 basis points year over year in total. At the upper end of the forecast, we implied we'd be up 80 basis points. So, again, you know that's the range that we think it's appropriate; range for Q2.

OPERATOR: Ron Josey with JMP Securities.

RON JOSEY, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to margins, and a little bit more on AWS. As I look at the seasonality. I wonder if there's any seasonality in margins?

Given, it looks like margins in 2Q and 3Q came in sub 10% versus maybe mid-teens in the -- in 4Q and 1Q. And then, sort of, looking at a different way, maybe given the dip in profitability in 2Q of last year. Did that have any impact from the pricing cuts in April? Thanks very much.

PHIL HARDIN: So, let's start with the increase sequentially in margin from Q2, or Q3 to Q4 of 2014. So, revenue grew by about 21.5% sequentially and expense grew by around 10%. And, so obviously, we were growing faster on the top line than our expenses.

And, over the long term improvements in efficiency and innovation allow us to drive that kind of cost out of the business. I mean, there certainly was an impact with pricing changes and you probably saw some of that in Q2 as well. But, over the long term, that's the model we follow. Great, thank you.

PHIL HARDIN: And, with that, thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2014 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions). Today's call is being recorded.

   TD
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.

PHIL HARDIN, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer Business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 29, 2015, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC -- each of which is posted on our IR website -- you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Phil. I will begin with comments on our fourth-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 25% to $6.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased to $1.95 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with capital and finance leases.

Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by the average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million one year ago.

I will turn the call over to Brian for additional financial highlights.

BRIAN OLSAVSKY, VP OF FINANCE, GLOBAL CONSUMER BUSINESS, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Tom. Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion, or 18% excluding the $895 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year. EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21%, or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year-over-year.

Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 43% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA, units represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million.

Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.3%.

Now I will talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the Other Operating Expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing 72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion.

North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion, or a decrease of 1%, excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion, or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%.

International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 million in the prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591 million compared to operating income of $510 million in the prior year.

Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share.

Now I will discuss the full-year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion, and international revenue grew 12% to $33.52 billion or 14%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.81 billion or 10%, excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior year. GAAP operating income decreased 76% to $178 million.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $4.97 billion year-over-year to $17.42 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $8.30 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion, and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior year.

And now back to Tom with guidance.

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks, Brian. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand; and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements; record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates; and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion, a growth of between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.

GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $450 million loss and $50 million in income, compared to $146 million in income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between zero and $500 million in income compared to $502 million income in the first quarter of 2014.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North America, International, and Amazon Web Services, beginning with first-quarter 2015. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.

Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.

PHIL HARDIN: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call.

Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Brian Pitz, Jefferies and Company.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Just a quick question. You had a strong holiday season -- 100 million more items shipped for free this holiday -- while FBA units was up 50%, and fulfillment expense remained relatively flat. How did you manage that? Are the new sortation centers essentially the key to controlling shipping costs? And what percent of units sold are FBA? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the last part of your question, the percentage of FBA units of third-party paid physical units are over 40%. And in terms of the fulfillment discussion, we certainly -- Q4 is our most seasonal quarter. You can see that we get a little bit better leverage, I should say, than we've gotten in other quarters; again, most seasonal quarter. Not a lot to add to that, but we continue to ship on behalf of obviously our retail offerings as well as FBA, that's included in that.

BRIAN PITZ: Great, thanks.

OPERATOR: Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley.

KATY HUBERTY, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: There's a headline on the tape referencing improving productivity in 2015. So I just wondered if you could clarify what areas of the business you are focused on in terms of productivity. And then what are some of the projects or areas that we should be prepared to see a large uptick in investment in 2015?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, I think what you are referring to, as I mentioned on the earlier call, that we do an annual planning process. We actually start it in the late summer, early fall. We go through that process; we take a break for the seasonal holidays, and then we get back to it. So we're in the process of finalizing it right now. And the teams are putting even more energy and attention on driving what we would call fixed expense and variable expense productivity, as well as other efficiency projects. So there's many, many different pieces that go into that. But certainly we've added a lot of people and structural over the last several years. And so we have been putting focus on that, but we're just putting even more focus on it as we finalize our plans for 2015.

KATY HUBERTY: And what areas should we expect big upticks in, in investment, in 2015?

TOM SZKUTAK: You'll have to -- in terms of investment, certainly we're going to continue to support the growth of the business. You should expect that we'll be spending more in terms of CapEx to support our Web Services business, which is growing very fast. You should expect us to add fulfillment capacity. As we've done in prior years, we have updated you a bit as we've gone along. And so we'll do that from time to time during the year, as well, in 2015. So stay tuned on that.

KATY HUBERTY: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Ron Josey, JMP Securities.

RON JOSEY, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Real quickly on fulfillment costs, it looks like overall costs accelerated quite a bit, to around 17% growth in 4Q from 30% in 3Q. I'm wondering if anything specific led to that improved overall growth from -- is it maybe the key of a rollout? And then, quickly, I think there was mentioning around breaking out AWS results. Wondering if any reason now? Perhaps it's getting to a level that you have to do it? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, in terms of the fulfillment piece, there's not a lot of callouts on that. We had unit growth of 20% year-over-year. Certainly, our FBA is growing at a faster rate; the sellers are up 65% over year. It's greater than 40% of our units. And, again, the teams continues to work on getting productivity there. In terms of AWS, yes, we just think it's an appropriate way to look at our business for 2015. And so our plan is to start breaking it out as of Q1 of this year.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

KAIZAD GOTLA, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks. This is Kaizad Gotla in for Doug. I think you noted Prime is growing faster internationally than it is in North America. So can you help us reconcile that with the difference between your North America and international EGM growth rates?

TOM SZKUTAK: If you take a look -- yes, what I had mentioned was Prime, worldwide, is up 53% year-over-year, so it's growing very fast globally. It's 50% growth in the US, and even higher in international. And so what I was -- the reason -- both are contributing to the growth rates that you're seeing, but we're certainly at an earlier stage in international. So it's an opportunity for us. But in terms of the number of Prime members relative to the US is smaller, so it's an earlier phase. So again, as we continue to grow that, it's an opportunity for us, and certainly something that we're focused on.

OPERATOR: Carlos Kirjner, Bernstein Research.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN: I have two questions. Can you comment on your view of the relative value proposition of Prime in European markets and Japan? Is it similar to the US? You know, two-day shipping and all the other benefits, or is it different because -- we think, for example, that penetration of Prime in the European markets is much lower. And you have told us that the number of Prime SKUs is much lower in the UK, for example. So, what's the fundamental cause of that? Why is it that Prime in the UK is not as developed as in the US? Is it timing or is it the proposition?

The second question is about AWS. You have a leadership position now, and it's a very large market. And it's easy to see from the outside that you are hiring aggressively, both in engineering and sales. Given the size of the opportunity and your position, what specifically prevents you from hiring faster, developing more products, investing more? How do you balance -- what prevents you from doing that? Why wouldn't you invest twice or three times as much in AWS? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of -- I'll take the AWS one first. We are expanding very rapidly. We are -- have been hiring a lot of great people over the past few years, and several years. We do think it's a big opportunity. We're making sure we keep the hiring bar really high to make sure we're bringing great resources, like we do across all of Amazon. And we're super-excited about the opportunity, so we are investing very heavily.

You see that certainly in our CapEx numbers. And the assets that we are acquiring with some of our capital leases, you see that represented. So again, we are investing very heavily, both in terms of people as well as capital for that business, and we share your excitement about the business.

In terms of the Prime piece, that proposition is a bit different by geography. And we continue to make it better in all of the geographies that we have Prime. That's something that we're focused on. The shipping speed is different by geography a bit, and so -- but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies.

But the one thing is different is -- you mentioned is that the proposition or the timing -- so the proposition is a little bit different. But we'll continue to work on making a better for all the geographies we have it in. But the timing is different.

We did launch in the US first, and we launched in other geographies following that; so, as a result, it's just earlier in these other geographies. So we still think it's a very good opportunity, and something that we're focused on.

OPERATOR: Mark May, Citigroup.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: One on -- I am sorry if I missed this. What's your thought or outlook for pricing in the AWS Cloud business for this year? It was obviously quite fierce last year. Do you think it will be quite as competitive in 2015?

And then in the media business, we've been hearing data points about a slowdown in the e-book space. Are you seeing that? And what's your outlook? Do you see any hope for the media segment to improve as a result of that? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first question, we have continued to lower prices for customers in Web services. Certainly that's something that we've been focused on since early launch. It's something that we continue to focus on. It's hard to predict what will happen going forward, so really can't comment on what we might or might not do there. But, certainly, it is something that we've had since launch. We've had many, many -- it's in the high 40s, in think, in terms of pricing actions there. So we're very excited to make sure that we have great prices for customers.

In terms of that media, you are seeing an overall media growth, globally. You are seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out, certainly one of the larger factors, or largest factor, that's in that number is -- keep in mind that we have -- we do game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers. And last year was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is when you have those launches, you also have video games that are -- the video game sales themselves are also strong. So, for example, if you look at North American media growth rate in Q4 of this past year, you're seeing that impact. So that's what you're seeing there.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Tom, can ask you a high-level question?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Go for it, Mark.

MARK MAHANEY: Okay. Amazon has always pitched itself in terms of price, selection, and convenience to customers. And I saw this great survey work that was done by Morgan Stanley in the last couple of weeks about this global survey that indicated a little bit of the shift in consumers' interest in online commerce, more towards convenience. You must have a pretty good feel at Amazon for whether that broad value proposition to consumers is shifting; if it's shifting to be slightly less sensitive to price over the last couple of years, and more towards convenience.

Are you seeing that kind of shift? There's a lot of implications if that is, in fact, what's happening.

TOM SZKUTAK: I would say it this way. In terms of customer reaction, you see it really across the fundamental inputs that we've talked about for a long time. So in other words, in terms of speed of delivery and convenience, we see that with Prime members. Prime members are buying more. It's more convenient. They are getting their physical product to them faster versus being not a Prime member. So we certainly see that, so that certainly speed of delivery helps.

We also see -- we need to make sure, and it's something that we're always focused on, is making sure we have great prices. And that's every single item across categories, across geographies. So it's something we've focused on. We do think that's important for customers. And we need to be -- have the selection be in stock when a customer comes to our detail page. It matters.

So I don't view it as a shift. I view it as -- there's certainly a lot of visibility and transparency around all of these. That's what shopping and operating a business online does. There's just a tremendous amount of transparency. We think -- we like that world. And that's something that we continue to focus on those inputs so that we can be successful in that world. And that's not something new. That's something we've been focused on for a long time.

OPERATOR: Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer.

JASON HELFSTEIN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER & CO.: Two questions. One, just if you can clarify any impact of the Fire phone in the quarter. And then secondly, can you talk about how fuel prices impact your model? And I know the shippers, they use a trailing index to calculate fuel, how those savings would show up, or if you would pass those on to third parties, et cetera. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, there's not -- I don't have really any callout for the Fire phone. We continue to sell. I had mentioned we had a little bit over $80 million of inventory at the end of Q3, and it will continue to sell through that in Q4.

In terms of fuel prices, not a lot to call out there in terms of impact on the quarter. Certainly, over a long period of time, if it's sustainable, we should see some benefits there.

OPERATOR: Gene Munster, Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: Over the past couple of years, it's just been a little bit of a roller coaster with margins for investors. There's points of optimism followed by points of frustration. And there's really some optimism here in this report. Is there anything that you can help investors with to understand just how you think about different cycles of investing, to try to smooth out some of this roller coaster mentality that happens with the stock? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, in terms of -- I would describe it this way, Gene. We have a lot of opportunities in front of us that we've talked about. And we're also being selective with those opportunities. We have added a lot of resources over the past few years. We certainly have been in a heavy investment cycle. I mentioned earlier, we're in the process of finalizing our plan for 2015. We always put energy into various productivity measures. But we're putting even -- the team is putting even more focus on those efforts as we finalize our 2015 plans.

We'll have to see where that ends up, but putting more energy and focus around our various fixed productivity, variable expense productivity, efficiency projects. And again, a wide range of different activities. And so, that's what we're doing, and you'll have to stay tuned to see how that progresses as we go.

OPERATOR: Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: I had two questions. First on India, can you talk about the India opportunity broadly, and maybe some advantages you may have versus some of the local peers in terms of leveraging your scale? That market appears to be just on fire right now, so just a little bit of color on India.

And then on Prime, can you talk about the Prime member behavior in terms of purchasing frequency? How it looks today versus maybe a Prime member that joined two years ago? I know it looks a lot different from those very early Prime adopters from six, seven years ago. But just more recently, over the last couple of years, is the behavior consistent as you grow the base? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of India, we think it's very, very early. We are investing, certainly, in India and we think it's a very interesting opportunity. We have a very good team there, and we're excited to participate. And again, we think it is very early, so we like the opportunity there.

In terms of Prime, there's not a lot I can help you with on that, but I would say is this: certainly as you think about customers who are not Prime that become Prime, we see a very sizable step-up in their purchasing patterns. And so, the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us.

And one of the things that we're seeing -- another thing that we're seeing is certainly, as Jeff references in the quote, Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital offering. It's unique that way. We see, for example -- although it is still very early, and we're learning and investing in this area -- but I take video content, for example. What we see is customers that come in who come in through our Prime pipeline for video, for a free trial, those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels. We see that customers that are streamers, video streamers; even though we have high renewal rates, they are renewing at even higher rates than others.

We see those people who are customers who are streaming have a very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who don't. And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer experience standpoint, which we think is great.

And so those are the things that we're seeing in Prime right now. And with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we think is very interesting. And it's something that we're very focused on as we continue forward.

OPERATOR: Eric Sheridan, UBS Investment Research.

ERIC SHERIDAN, ANALYST, UBS: On the topic of China, wanted to know if you could help us either qualitatively or quantitatively understand what that trajectory or the size of the business is in China. And then maybe the trajectory around investments needed to compete in China, and how you think about the opportunity there long-term, looking through the lens of the competitive landscape, and maybe Amazon's particular skill set on going to market in China. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. We haven't broken out the size of the business. I can't help you much there. But we continue to work on the customer experience there. The team has some interesting ideas that you'll have to stay tuned on of how to make that experience better, and we continue to work on it. So, there's not a lot more that I can add to that.

OPERATOR: John Blackledge, Cowen and Company.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Just a couple questions. In North American media, aside from the video game impact, just wondering if there are any other factors driving the low or flattish growth year-over-year. And then, CapEx was up about 40% in 2014. It has kind of bounced around over the years. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of the level of growth in 2015. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the North American media, a number of different, certainly, puts and takes there. But certainly, by far, the biggest one is the one I called out, which is the video game consoles. So if you look at the growth rate in Q4 last year, meaning 2013, and Q4 2014, you see a big difference. And the biggest, the most sizable difference there is certainly the video game consoles portion, and the video games associated with those.

So another way to say it is, the video game consoles and video games portion of that is down year-over-year. And obviously, years ago, we put the video game consoles as part of North American media to keep it with video games, and their kind of larger ASP items, as well, to go in there. So certainly having an impact on that when you look at the growth [row] and you compare 2013 growth -- Q4 2013 growth to Q4 2014 growth there.

In terms of CapEx, we're not giving guidance on the 2015 spend. But given the high usage rates that we've had in Web Services, you should expect that we'll be spending CapEx to support that growth. And we'll certainly be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also, keep in mind that we do also finance capital. So if you look at our capital lease activity, point to that -- that's also increased in activity over the last few years.

Certainly a number of different investments that are going -- different types of CapEx that go into that financing; but the biggest piece is certainly infrastructure to support our business, primarily on the AWS side. So, again, that's also included in that number.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Tom, I was hoping you could give us some kind of sense of the impact on delivery times and conversion rates that you saw during this holiday season from the investments that you made in fulfillment, particularly the sortation centers that were added before the holidays. And then also, to what degree you've seen some leverage, or some of the slower growth in fulfillment costs, from moving more of the fulfillment obligation to first-party-owned infrastructure?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the sort centers -- and I would say just in -- I would say, in addition to sort centers, what's happened over the course of the last several years is, with all the fulfillment centers that we've added, we've actually gotten selection closer to customers. And so, that's helped us from a delivery speed standpoint. It has helped us from a cost standpoint in terms of transportation cost, being closer to customers. And so, it's a natural result of the footprint that we've added.

In terms of sortation centers, there's a lot of different benefits to that. But certainly one of them is as you get closer and closer -- certainly throughout the year it's helped us with holiday deliveries; it's helped us with Sunday deliveries. And as we get closer to, in this case, December to the holiday -- end of the holidays, it has certainly helped us from a delivery to customer standpoint. So we're very pleased with the performance of those sortation centers. And really the global team, fulfillment team around the world, I think they did a terrific job during the holiday season, as they did throughout the year.

OPERATOR: Mark Miller, William Blair and Company.

MARK MILLER, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR AND COMPANY: There's quite a disparate performance between North America and international, in terms of the profit change year-on-year, up nearly $300 million; North America down over $100 million. So could you just help us understand why the international performance is so much weaker? Perhaps give us some color on the established markets in Europe, relative to emerging markets. And in the past, you've also discussed Japan. And then is there an inflection point where international profits we could expect to head up again?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. The first one is certainly the growth rates, the real growth rates, are slower in international versus North America; certainly would have an impact. The second is we continue to invest in international in terms of adding capacity for infrastructure, for fulfillment capacity. As our -- if you look at our international growth rates, the unit growth rates are actually growing at a higher rate than revenue.

And then emerging geographies; we talked about India earlier. Very excited about India. We are investing in India. We are also investing in China. So those are certainly impacting the results as well.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: I wanted to ask about gross margins. They were up quite a bit year-over-year, and it looks like, in our numbers, EGM beat and media missed. So, any thoughts on the mix shift there helping or hurting gross margins? What are the key drivers for that line, and what are your -- can AWS continue to drive that in 2015? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Certainly AWS -- mix of business is having an impact. AWS is certainly part of that, and impacting that. Also just to keep in mind, our third-party growth is growing at a faster rate than retail, and so certainly that's having an impact. And then obviously continuing to lower prices for customers, as well as working with our partners on the vendor side to support those activities from a pricing standpoint. So those are the dynamics.

And in terms of 2015, beyond the guidance that we're giving, there's not a lot of call-out there. But we've had a great success of being to grow our retail offerings. Our Marketplace side has grown very nicely over the years, including 2014. The team has done a great job there. Fulfilled by Amazon, in terms of number of sellers, continue to grow there. The percentage of paid physical units are approximately 40%, or a little over 40% of the total there. So that has become much more meaningful over the past several years; so, very happy about that. So all those contribute to the numbers that you just talked about.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, Robert W. Baird.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: One question, as a follow-up on AWS, and specifically some of the announcements related to WorkMail and WorkSpaces. This would signal that Amazon is moving up the stack towards a more of a SaaS offering. Is that the right interpretation? And, if so, should we expect a broadening of those SaaS product initiatives? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: You know, very happy to have the launch, make the launch that you mentioned. We think it's exciting. It's certainly -- we're excited overall about Web Services offerings. The team has done an incredible job in terms of innovation, as well as operating these large services at scale. So they're doing a terrific job. In terms of what we might or might not do in the future, we're not talking about what that roadmap is, so you'll have to stay tuned.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Macquarie Equities Research.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE EQUITY RESEARCH: [Can you] just give any color on how you are evaluating the opportunities to show video advertising against the ever-increasing video content? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we really aren't using advertising too much in that area. You've seen it a little bit on some of our original content. But beyond that, we really can't comment. We think the experience we have is great for customers. We get a lot of positive feedback on the content that we have there, and the uninterrupted content, if you will. And so wouldn't speculate on what we might or might not do there, but we're getting great feedback from customers.

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2014 financial results teleconference.

   TD
(Operator Instructions)

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead.

PHIL HARDIN, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflects management's views as of today, October 23, 2014 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factor that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, and our press releases, slides accompanying this website, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 15% to $5.71 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.08 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.63 billion.

The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital was 6%, up from 3%.

ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 481 million shares compared with 475 million one year ago.

World-wide revenue grew 20% to $20.58 billion, or 20% excluding the $13 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $5.24 billion, up 4%, or 4% excluding exchange.

EGM revenue increased to $13.95 billion, up 26%, or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 68% of world-wide sales, up from 65%. World-wide paid unit growth was 21%, active customer accounts was approximately 260 million, world-wide active seller accounts were more than 2 million, seller units represented 42% of paid units.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.63 billion or 71.1% of revenue compared with 72.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $6.09 billion, or 29.6% of sales, up approximately 350 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $2.55 billion or 12.4% of revenue compared with 11.5%. Tech and content was $2.22 billion or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $961 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 3.9%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items.

In the North America segment revenue grew 25% to $12.87 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.73 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $8.79 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 40% to $1.34 billion.

North America segment operating income decreased 70% to $88 million, a 0.7% operating margin. In the international segment revenue grew 14% to $7.71 billion. Excluding the $21 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact revenue growth was 13%.

Media revenue grew 4% to $2.51 billion or 3% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 20% to $5.16 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 64%.

International segment operating loss was $224 million compared to international segment operating loss of $28 million in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss was $136 million compared to consolidated segment operating income of $267 million in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating loss includes charges of approximately $170 million primarily related to the Fire Phone inventory evaluation and supplier commitment costs.

Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $544 million compared to operating loss of $25 million in the prior period.

Our income tax benefit was $205 million. GAAP net loss was $437 million or $0.95 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $41 million and $0.09 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $806 million year over year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $7.32 billion. And inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.2 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $11.81 billion. And accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 75 in the prior year.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.

It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.

Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements; record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates; and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q4 2014, we expect net sales of between $27.3 billion and $30.3 billion, a growth between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 250 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $570 million loss and $430 million income compared to $510 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $470 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense, to be between $100 million loss and $900 million in income compared to $876 million in income in fourth-quarter 2013.

We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareowners. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.

PHIL HARDIN: Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Thank you. Our first question comes from analyst Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Great, thanks. Two quick questions. Can you provide any color on the consumer over this year's back-to-school season? And how do you view the outlook for the consumer as we head into the holidays?

And then, separately, you recently closed the acquisition of Twitch last month. Can you help us understand where does Twitch fit into your overall digital content strategy? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of back-to-school, certainly the results are reflected in the Q3 results that you see today. There's a number of different impacts back-to-school has. One thing I would like to call out, as you look at our North American media growth rates, one thing that we are seeing is certainly a shift from a textbook standpoint from purchase to rental. And, so, we see a lot more customers renting, so you see that impacting the growth rate a bit in North America media.

But in terms of Q4, as in any Q4 when we look at it, there's a wide range of outcomes with giving a wide range of guidance. What we feel good about is we have a team that's been improving customer experience over the past 12 months. We're very excited to serve customers. We've had a lot of unique selection. We've got an inventory closer to customers, many different things we're doing on behalf of customers. We're very excited about the holiday season and look forward to serving customers.

In terms of Twitch, we're very excited to have Twitch as part of our overall team. We've been in video games for quite some time and we think that it's a very creative team. They're doing some very innovative things on behalf of their customers and our customers. And, so, we're excited to have them be part of Amazon, and look forward to working together with that team.

BRIAN PITZ: Great, thanks.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will come from Carlos Kirjner, analyst, with Bernstein.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: Thank you for taking my question. Two, if I may. International CSOI margin this quarter were the lowest they have been in years, maybe ever I don't know. We know you have been investing internationally but has something changed fundamentally? And if yes, what.

Secondly, I wanted to ask you about a vast difference in revenue growth rate between your international and domestic business. What is the fundamental difference between the US and your main international markets? And is this difference fundamental or temporary? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks for the questions. In terms of the consolidated segment or the segment operating for international, certainly versus what you would have seen last quarter, some notable changes. One is we're certainly getting ready for the holiday season. So, as we get ready for the holiday season, we are expanding from a capacity standpoint.

We do see we've gotten great penetration in Fulfilled by Amazon customers. So you'll see that actually our growth rate, our unit growth rate, is actually higher than our revenue growth rate. That's what we've been experiencing. So, certainly adding capacity from a fulfillment perspective, adding capacity from a infrastructure standpoint.

If you look at our overall operating expenses, we're certainly investing. With the slower growth rate, you're certainly not seeing as much leverage. We understand that we do have to get leverage over time, but we are investing right now. We're also investing in newer emerging geographies including India and Italy and Spain, and continue to invest in China.

And then one other call out. We had mentioned in my opening remarks there was approximately $170 million impact related to inventory evaluations and supplier commitment costs. The vast majority of that was in North America, but there was about $25 million in international, just to let you know that's there.

In terms of the growth rates, it has been softer across a number of geographies. If you look back over the past, really, four quarters, we've seen a little bit of volatility between the quarters, but it's been softer. We continue to focus on the inputs. We still think international is a very big opportunity for us in terms of growth.

More recently, if you look at the growth rate for Q3 and you see the 13% excluding foreign exchange, you may remember on the last call about 90 days ago I talked about Q2. What had happened was, in late Q1 we had seen a ramp up in Japan before the consumption tax increase happened on April 1. We saw a pretty sizeable drop off in Japan growth rates from Q1 to Q2, which brought that down.

The only update -- again, there's a number of different puts and takes in geographies -- but the only other comment I would say is that we really haven't seen Japan growth rates improving since Q2. So, that's something that's there.

But in terms of the fundamentals, long term we're very excited about international, as well as North America. We think that it's a big opportunity. We continue to focus on the inputs. Some of those inputs are certainly on the media side working on the conversion from physical media to digital media. We continue to work on that in a number of different ways. We continue to add new selection in those geographies and work on the retail basics. And so, again, we're very excited about the opportunity.

CARLOS KIRJNER: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next call will come from analyst Scott Devitt with Stifel.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Hi, Tom. Thanks. I had a question just broadly. A lot of the capital that's been deployed in terms of planting seeds in new businesses have worked out very well. But given what's happening right now in terms of the deterioration in the margin structure as growth is slowing, I'm just wondering, I think a lot of investors have this question as well in terms of when things don't go as anticipated in some of the bigger projects where there's not a revenue stream, areas maybe like some of the hardware projects and China and other markets, what's the process for determining whether to plow ahead or turn back capital and redeploy it in other areas? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks for the question, Scott. With anything new that we do, and obviously we've done, as you mentioned we've done a lot of new things, there's certainly a wide range of outcome. And we certainly understand that. We try to learn from everything that we do as we launch new opportunities. That's something across things that go great and things that don't go as well as others. We try to learn from that.

And, so, the way that I would describe it is, from a looking-forward standpoint, we still think that we have a lot of opportunities. That said, we need to be very selective about what opportunities we pursue. So, that's, again, the way we're thinking about it. Probably not much more I can add to it than that.

SCOTT DEVITT: Okay, thank you.

OPERATOR: We'll continue on to analyst Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Two questions, please. That $170 million in charges related to the Fire Phone, where was that put in the P&L, which of the OpEx lines, or was it a COGS? And then, secondly, in the media side you talked about maybe seeing a negative impact, or definitely seeing a negative impact from the switch towards owning to renting. Do you think that's a broader trend just beyond textbooks that affects all media retailers including Amazon? Could that be one of the issues behind the slow media growth in international markets? And if so, is there really a solution to that other than your own rental models? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the first question, the $170 million, it's predominantly in COGS. The very vast majority is in COGS. And then in terms of the split about $25 million of that is in international and the remainder is in North America.

In terms of the growth, we certainly are seeing that in textbooks. We do see in other digital media, we're certainly seeing rentals being part for our portfolio, more than we had probably during certainly with physical. But in terms of some of the recent growth rates the one that I called out related to book rentals is certainly impacting North America media.

One of the other things that's really impacting it, too, is we just had some things last year Q3 that were overlapping, that were paused in Q3 last year from a demand standpoint. One was, certainly, in physical books we had very heavy discounting, which helped our growth in Q3 last year. We're overlapping that in Q3 this year.

MARK MAHANEY: Thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: Thank you. We'll now go to analyst Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.

ARAM RUBINSON, ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH: Hello, and thanks for taking my question. Hoping we can go back to square one here, if you don't mind. Can you tell us, or remind us, what financial measures are important to you, and which financial measures do you hold yourselves and the Board hold you accountable to? Because it's a little hard to see any of it making positive progress, so I just would love to get back to basics.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. We're looking at a number of different metrics over a long period of time. And certainly our goal is to maximize free cash flow over the long term. We don't focus on individual margins, but we do focus on the inputs that are going to help drive free cash flow and operating income.

We certainly will look at making sure that we're using our capital wisely so that over time we get good returns on invested capital. And we certainly have been in several years now of what I would call an investment mode, because of the opportunities that we've had in front of us. As I mentioned earlier, there's still lots of opportunity in front of us, but we know that we have to be very selective about which opportunities we pursue. But we're encouraged by the opportunities that we have.

ARAM RUBINSON: So cash flow and return on invested capital is where we should keep our attention?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes.

ARAM RUBINSON: And are the employees on the recruiting side, is that becoming more difficult as the stock has faded a little bit, and those return characteristics have faded? How are you making sure that you're hiring the best people?

TOM SZKUTAK: We have processes in place to make sure that we have a very high bar on the hiring that we do. The people that we're hiring are extraordinarily talented. We're very fortunate to get to work with so many talented people here. And we've been fortunate to be able to grow that employment base to work on the opportunities that we have.

ARAM RUBINSON: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. We'll go to analyst Colin Gillis with BGC Financial.

COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC PARTNERS: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just to get back to that North American media sales, it was the lowest growth rate in over 20 quarters. Are there other factors beyond the textbook shift and the Q3 strength last year? Are the digital media trends still intact?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the principal drivers, it's the two that I mentioned. It's the textbook rentals and also overlapping some of the strong discounting in strong titles that we had in some categories. So it's across a number of categories within the media. But those are the two principal drivers.

COLIN GILLIS: You don't see this as a broader shift in that number?

TOM SZKUTAK: No. Still, both in terms of North America and international, there is certainly a shift that's going on from physical to digital. And that's something that we're spending a lot of time on and trying to improve the experience for customers. And we've been able to do that certainly over a period of time. And so it's something that we'll continue to work on.

COLIN GILLIS: Okay, thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Ron Josey with JMP Securities.

RON JOSEY, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two, please. If you could update us on this rotation center rollout. Are all 15 online? And I'd love to know maybe how they've helped bridge the last mile and improve overall speed delivery.

And then the second question, switching gears and just focusing on advertising, I believe a pilot was launched or beta was launched for Amazon's ad network called CPM Ads, I think maybe late August. I'm wondering if you could provide some commentary there. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of sort centers we'll have over 15 sort centers in the US by the end of the year. It's certainly helping us a lot. We have same day delivery in 12 cities. We'll have Sunday delivery in approximately 50% of the population. And, so, we're pleased to do that.

And in terms of the ad network there's not a lot I can say there.

RON JOSEY: Okay, thank you very much.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.

AARON KESSLER, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, INC.: Great, thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us an update maybe on your views on original programming? It looked like Transparent's had some good success.

Also, just from an international standpoint, your views on the growth in China, India, as well as are you seeing signs of any increasing competition in the international, your key international markets today?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of original content we're excited about it. We're investing as we talked about last quarter. We spent approximately $100 million in the quarter. Keep in mind that that's expensed in the quarter and so that's included in the results that you see in Q3. We're very excited about it.

We have a number of pilots, as well as a number of series launched. Transparent, you mentioned, is one of them. It's gotten very good reviews. The streaming on that series has been great. So, we're very excited about it and we think it's an interesting area for customers.

We continue to invest heavily in video content, including originals. There's a number of different metrics we're looking at certainly from a Prime standpoint. What we are seeing so far is those customers who are streaming are renewing at considerably higher rates, at a rate that's already high. So, we like what we see there.

When customers come in for new trials, free trials, and they engage from a video content standpoint, we see the conversion being higher. So, we see that we're adding new Prime members as a result of that. When those new Prime members become Prime members, the other thing we're seeing is they are buying physical product, which is a great impact for us. We see very similar patterns in terms of how much physical product that they're purchasing from us.

We're still certainly in investment mode there, but we like what we see. We have a long way to go there but we're concentrating on building a great service. And we see that customers are rewarding us with engagement on the content, both original and licensed. And they're buying more from us on the physical side and becoming Prime members when they do, and renewing at higher rates.

So, those are some of the early signs. We'll continue to monitor it very closely. But we're excited about what we're seeing there.

In terms of some of the international comments, and I would say this not just international but I'd say it for the US, as well. One thing that's not new is it's a very competitive environment. We have a lot of competitors both online and offline. That's not anything that's new. We are used to operating in that environment. We've been in that environment, really, for 19 years. But we are seeing a lot of competition. Again, that's not new.

AARON KESSLER: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will come from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great, thanks. Last quarter you mentioned that the AWS business saw a 90% increase in volume. Was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you've seen so far this quarter.

And then in the highlight section of the release, the first six bullet points or so that you have there are all related to the hardware side of the business. If you can just give us, now that you have a little bit more time on the hardware side of the business behind you, if you can give us a sense of what you're learning in this category and where you think Amazon's long-term position in hardware is ultimately going to be.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of AWS, we saw a very good growth in Q3, as well. From a usage standpoint, it's very similar to Q2, close to 90%. And, so, the team's doing just a fantastic job.

You can see our other revenue in North America went up a little bit sequentially. AWS is certainly the largest piece of that and it's the vast majority of it. They're growing at a faster rate than that other line item. So, again, the team is doing a fantastic job in not only serving customers, but launching many new features and services. And you can see some of the detail in that in the highlight section of our release today. So we're very excited about it.

In terms of devices, I can't speculate what we would do going forward. But we just launched a number of new tablets and E-readers that we're excited about. There's some really great price points for customers on the tablet side. We also launched a kids' tablet, which is the first time we've launched.

We've launched some new Kindles, including our premium Kindle. It's a terrific product. We think it's the best Kindle we've made to date, for sure, and so we're very excited about that. And we're excited to have these offerings for customers.

HEATH TERRY: Great, thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Ben Schachter with Macquarie.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Hi, Tom. You mentioned that you need to get leverage at some point, and last call you also said something similar. But can you help you quantify the timing? In your internal modeling, when do you expect to see more meaningful leverage? When you look at your three-to-five outlook, what does the leverage picture look like there? And then, also, can you remind us what your philosophy of stock buybacks is and what it would take to get you back in the market? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of leverage, beyond the guidance that we're giving today, there's not a lot of certainty I can give you. But, again, what I'd mentioned earlier is we do have a lot of opportunities, but our job is to be judicious and selective about which opportunities we pursue. And, so, that's the way we're thinking about it. I apologize I can't give you any more certainty in terms of timing, but certainly that's the way we're thinking about it.

In terms of buybacks, we have an open buyback right now. We have authorization to do that. I certainly can't comment on what price points we would or wouldn't do there.

OPERATOR: Thank you. We'll continue on to analyst Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Great, thank you. If you look at the phone impact in Q3, it seems to explain some of the difference versus the Street. But when you look forward to Q4 it looks like you're guiding to about 15% to 16% growth ex-FX, and again profits maybe below expectations.

Is the phone having an impact on profits in Q4, as well? And, also, when you think about the Q4 guidance, are there any events or things you want to call out? Are you being especially conservative in Q4 given recent trends? Anything different this year in the holiday?

Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, in terms of the holiday season, Justin, if you look back the last several years, I've been giving wide ranges because it's, again, our most seasonal quarter, always challenging to predict precisely where we're going to be. In terms of a dollar range, I gave a $3 billion range last year, I'm giving a $3 billion range again this year from a revenue perspective. Again, wide range. At the higher end of the range, excluding foreign exchange it's approximately 21%, so it's a little bit higher than what we saw in Q3. And then you can see we were on the low end of the range.

In terms of the season itself, we're very excited about it in terms of to serve customers. We feel great about the selection that we have added and are continuing to add for the holiday season. We think from an operations standpoint each year we try to get better, and we believe that we'll be even better this year than we have in previous years. And so we're super excited to serve customers.

In terms of the phone, the only other thing that I can comment on is, at the end of Q3, we had approximately $83 million worth of inventory on hand. I can't comment on how that would impact guidance or not, but that's the amount of inventory we had on hand at the end of Q3.

JUSTIN POST: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next analyst will be John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great. Thanks, just a couple questions. We saw that Amazon Fresh expanded into Brooklyn recently. Just wondering if you can discuss the decision to expand into New York City and how we should think about timing for expansion into other markets. And then if you can update us on the number of fulfillment centers globally ending the year, that would be great. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the number of fulfillment centers it's 13 net for the year. And then, as I mentioned earlier, in the US we'll have more than 15 sort centers by the end of the year.

In terms of -- sorry, the other part of the question was on Fresh? The team's doing a great job from a customer experience standpoint. As you can see we're in a few cities today. The team is just heads down focused on making sure that experience is great for customers. We continue -- customers like the service. So, we're seeing good pick up there.

And as you mentioned, we're expanding into Brooklyn. I can't speculate on what we do beyond the cities that we have launched to date, but we're excited about what we're seeing so far there.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question will come from analyst Eric Sheridan with UBS.

ERIC SHERIDAN, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks for taking the question. Tom, you put through a price increase on the Prime service this year. Was curious what you were seeing in terms of the impact of that price increase on both the rate of adding people into Prime and the ability to control churn inside the Prime subscription base in general. And as you add additional functionality and layers into Prime, like you've done this year through the investments, whether you've thought about maybe putting in another price increase through next year. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of what we do going forward, I certainly wouldn't speculate. We had a price point since our initiation, since the launch of Prime at $79. So it took us a long time. And we were very careful with that to increase it to $99.

But since we've increased to $99 we've had great retention. We're very pleased with the retention we've had from customers. The program is growing very fast. We're very excited about it. And, so, we do think that it's really good for customers and it's really good for us and shareowners over the long term.

You're correct in that we're investing in Prime in a number of different ways, including video content, as I talked about earlier. That is certainly the way we will get a return on that investment principally, will be customers buying more, including, and especially, physical products. Again, we're very excited about Prime globally.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next analyst will be Brian Nowak with SIG.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA INTERNATIONAL GROUP: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, please. The first one, fulfillment ex stock-based comp was the highest it's ever been as a percentage of gross profit in the third quarter. Can you just talk about the drivers of that? Is that sortation centers or international growth? What's driving that?

And then as we think about the sortation centers what's the impact of those over next few quarters to fulfillment? Do they take awhile to get the inefficiencies out of the system like a standard DC would?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the fulfillment cost, you're right. Again, we are adding 13 net fulfillment centers. We'll have over 15 sort centers at the end of the year. Certainly one of the drivers for that is the growth that we're experiencing.

But in addition to that what we're seeing is the FBA adoption continues to get better. We get further penetrated with sellers adopting Fulfilled by Amazon. We think that's really good for sellers and for us and for customers over the long term.

What you're seeing is, several years ago in terms of fulfillment center planning, we were adding less of them and it was much closer to the holiday season. With the sheer amount of capacity that we're adding you're seeing more of that come in even before Q4. So, you're seeing that impacting us earlier. And the benefit of coming in earlier is we get to serve customer, get up to the productivity rates that we want to to serve customers in Q4 by having that capacity in a bit earlier than in past. So, we've seen that trend happen over the past few years where that's coming in earlier than certainly historically we've been able to do.

BRIAN NOWAK: Okay, great, thanks.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next analyst will be Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.

MATT NEMER, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC: Thanks so much for taking my questions.

First, Prime launched a referral fee recently and I'm wondering if we should take that as any indication that the membership growth has slowed or you're seeing some higher churn. And how does that referral fee get accounted for?

And then, secondly, Target launched free shipping with no hurdle for the holidays versus your $35 hurdle. Just wondering what your willingness is to leave that competitive gap during the holidays. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: I can't comment from a competitive standpoint what we might or might not do there. But in terms of the Prime referral fee, no, you should not read into that that Prime isn't growing well. In fact, just the opposite. We are seeing great growth.

We like the fact that enabling customers, because they like Prime, to be able to refer others, we think is great for us. I can't actually -- maybe offline you can follow-up with Phil or Dave on the accounting. Off the top of my head I can't remember how that's working. But I know they will be able to answer it for you.

MATT NEMER: Okay, thanks so much.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: Great, thanks. Good afternoon.

A couple of follow-ups. First off, in terms of the Q4 revenue guide, are you giving any consideration in that forecast to some of the shipping issues that happened last holiday, and the ability of your shipping partners to manage your growth? And then, secondly, on paid units, can you provide a split or color between physical and digital unit growth?

Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the guidance, it reflects all of the assumptions that we think could happen for the quarter. So, again, it's a wide range. To speak specifically to some of the issues last year, the team, again, we continually are trying to learn from everything that we do, and the team has done a great job learning from our experiences coming out of Q4 last year, as we do every year, and are excited to serve customers.

In terms of the unit growth, there's not a lot I can add in terms of splits, other than the overall growth rate. But we are pleased with -- certainly we're seeing good customer growth. Sellers are -- we're doing, we think, a great job for sellers. We continue to add a lot of unique selection throughout the year in terms of, we have customers, we see FBA for sellers getting further penetrated.

We've launched, we think, some interesting products for customers. We think our Web Services team is doing a great job. We realize that we have a lot of opportunities, but we need to be selective on which opportunities we pursue. And I think beyond that, we're just overall excited and getting ready for the holiday season.

Anyway, thanks, everybody, for calling in today.

PHIL HARDIN: Thank you for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Good day and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2014 financial results teleconference.

   TD
(Operator Instructions)

Also, today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, Phil Hardin. Please go ahead, sir.

PHIL HARDIN, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect Management's views as of today July 24, 2014, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 18% to $5.33 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $1.04 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.29 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services.

Return on invested capital was 6% up from 2%. ROIC TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 480 million shares compared with 474 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.34 billion or 22% excluding the $237 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.

Media revenue increased to $4.84 billion up 10% or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.28 billion up 27% or 26% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 69% of worldwide sales up from 66%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%. Active customer accounts exceeded 250 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.4 billion or 69.3% of revenue compared with 71.4%.

Fulfillment, Marketing, Tech & Content, and G&A combined was $5.54 billion or 28.6% of sales up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.28 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.2%. Tech and Content was $2.02 billion or 10.4% of revenue compared with 9.1%. Marketing was $911 million or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.1%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $12 million. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.46 billion or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 29% to $8.37 billion representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 68%. Other revenue grew 38% to $1.17 billion. North America segment operating income increased 7% to $438 million, a 3.7% operating margin.

In the International segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.34 billion excluding the $246 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion or 4% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 25% to $4.91 billion or 20% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of International revenues, up from 63%. International segment operating loss was $34 million compared to zero in the prior period.

CSOI decreased 1% to $404 million or 2.1% of revenue, down approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI decreased 9%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.

GAAP operating loss was $15 million compared to operating income of $79 million in the prior-year period. Our income tax expense was $94 million and this includes approximately $90 million of discrete tax items primarily attributable to audit related developments. GAAP net loss was $126 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $7 million and $0.02 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $523 million year over year to $7.99 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $6.64 billion and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels, and introduce new product categories. Accounts payable increased 16% to $10.46 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 71, from 73 in the prior year.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates, can all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q3 2014, we expect net sales of between $19.7 billion and $21.5 billion or growth between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 120 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $810 million loss a $410 million loss compared to a $25 million loss in the third quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $410 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between a $400 million loss and $0 compared to $267 million of income in the third quarter of 2013. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that, Phil, let's move to questions.

PHIL HARDIN: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

We'll hear first today from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two if I may. Tom, you mentioned in the past that China is an area of investment. Can you say little bit about what are the main drivers of investment there, whether it's marketing pricing fulfillment? And how would you decide on any given year how much you invest in China just given the size of the potential market and opportunity?

And secondly, we saw a material deceleration in the North America Other revenues. Was this primarily driven by AWS deceleration, and is this deceleration a meaningful contributor to the losses implied in your next quarter guidance? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. I'll take the second part of the question first. Yes, North America Other includes a number of things including Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services is the largest part of North America other. You know, as we talked about on last call, we had very substantial price reductions for customers starting in second quarter. They range from 28% to 51% depending on the service.

But AWS continues to grow very strongly. In Q2, we had usage growth close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. So the team's doing a fantastic job, and we put in some price reductions that were very substantial that are saving customers hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several months as we mentioned 90 days ago. But again, we love that business. It's doing great and we are very pleased to have the opportunity to invest in it.

The team is innovating very quickly, in fact so far year-to-date, they've released 250 significant services and features. And that's at a pace that's much, much faster than last year's pace which was faster than the year before. So again, they are continuing to innovate on behalf of customers, and so we're investing. So that's certainly impacting both the pricing decisions we've made. It's certainly impacting the guidance.

Also the large amount of CapEx and infrastructure for that business is certainly impacting the guidance, along with a number of other things across the business that we're investing in. But we're very pleased to do that. In terms of China, you know we are continuing to invest on behalf of customers there. Obviously trying to make the experience even better for customers in terms of improved in-stock levels.

We've spent -- certainly added a lot of fulfillment capacity over time in China. And we're doing a lot of interesting things to better serve customers in China. In terms of some of the other parts of your question, there's not much more I can add to that.

CARLOS KIRJNER: Thank you.

OPERATOR: We'll hear next from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.

NEIL DOSHI, ANALYST, CRT CAPITAL: Tom, can you talk a little bit about the deceleration in the units and then also in terms of the third-party dollar, it looks like you're kind of trending on 40% for a while. It ticked up a little bit to 41%. So if we adjust for Digital, how should that trend be looking? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of unit growth, we had 23% unit growth year over year. It is down from last year's growth rate but it's consistent with what we've seen recently, including last quarter. And in terms of the unit -- the third-party units as a percentage of total units, you're right, that's 41% this quarter. It's up about 100 basis points, you know, and we are not breaking out the Digital versus Physical on that. But again, very strong third-party growth. Number of factors but certainly FBA is helping third-party growth.

OPERATOR: And we'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.

ERIC SHERIDAN, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks for taking the question. When looking through the expense lines, Tech and Content seem to have an upward pressure in the quarter. Wanted to maybe get a little more granularity on what was driving that upward pressure and whether that's sort of a new run rate of expense as we saw in the first half of this year. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: There's a number of things that are going into the Tech and Content line. But you're right, we're one of the ones that I just mentioned. We are investing, you know, in various parts of the business but certainly for Amazon Web Services, that's both from an infrastructure standpoint to support the very fast usage growth that we are experiencing.

Again, we have usage growth close to 90% year-over-year in the second quarter for web services. In addition to that, we've -- over the past year, we've added thousands of people in web services. So again, ramping that up. And then across a number of different other investment areas, we continue to add great technical resources to do the things we're doing in Digital and many other parts of the company.

So again, we have a lot of opportunities to invest in as you can see from a lot of the releases that we've had over the past, you know, 12 months and you're certainly seeing that reflected in our actual results as well.

OPERATOR: And next from JPMorgan we will go to Douglas Anmuth.

KAIZAD GOTLA, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking the question. This is Kaizad Gotla in for Doug. I was wondering if you could just talk about the deceleration in your international EGM line. And then separately, now that you've had the Prime price increases in effect for about three months, wondering if you could just talk about any changes you have seen in sign-ups or conversions there. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of international EGM, and this would really relate to total international growth as well, we saw 18% growth on a dollar basis, 14% growth on a local currency growth basis, which is down a little bit sequentially from what we saw in Q1. You know, obviously, there's variability from quarter-to-quarter in each of the geographies that we operate in.

You know, one call out which impacted certainly EGM and our total international growth rate is Japan. We saw on April 1 the consumption taxes increased from 5% to 8%. Leading up to that in the latter part of Q1, we certainly saw accelerated growth in -- so that was reflected in the Q1 results. In Q2, we saw some corresponding softness in Q2 following that.

Hard to know how much was related to consumption growth but certainly as you've probably read elsewhere that others are seeing that too so it's not -- probably reflects the consumption tax increase. But if you take out Japan out of both Q1 and Q2, the growth rates on a local currency basis were very similar, within approximately 100 basis points of each other.

In terms of Prime, Prime subscribers are growing very nicely year-over-year. In fact, we added more Prime subscribers in Q2 of this year than in Q2 of last year. So we're very pleased and customers are responding to -- continue to -- we continue to get new subscribers as well as existing customers responding to the great value they're getting out of Prime.

KAIZAD GOTLA: Helpful. Thanks.

OPERATOR: And from Citi we'll go to Mark May.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thanks for taking my question. Common sense based on sort of what you've talked about in the disclosures around the price -- the amount of the price decreases. But common sense would suggest that all, if not most, of the CSOI margin decline that you posted in Q2 year on year is related to the AWS price changes.

And common sense would also suggest that given the significant volume gains that you are seeing in that business that Q2 might be the most impacted quarter from that yet the third quarter guidance suggests that it's having an even greater impact on Q3.

Just wondering if you could help us think through that. Is there some timing issue related to the impact of that, or is there something else going on within the core retail business or maybe some other one-time items that might be impacting your Q3 outlook? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of we are not quantifying the impact of the price changes on our Q2 and Q3. But it is fair to say that the impact has certainly did impact our Q2 results in a meaningful way, and that's reflected in the actual results that you're seeing.

Another thing to keep in mind as you look out related to AWS is we're continuing to invest in that business. And with the great strong usage growth rates that we're seeing, we're also investing in CapEx and infrastructure to support that growth. So again, the team is doing a fantastic job innovating on behalf of customers, and as I mentioned earlier, the new releases both from a service and feature perspective was about 250 year to date which is at a pace that's much faster than we've seen over the last few years with very high bark given all the innovation that's happened from that team in that space.

So again, those are certainly things that are impacting Q3 guidance. There's a number of other things. When you look at Q3, keep in mind if you look back over the last several years, we're getting ready for our Q4 seasonal quarter. And when that happens, if you look back certainly, you've seen our CSOI usually has been at the lowest point for the year during Q3, particularly during these high-growth years.

And so we've added -- or announced that we are adding six net new fulfillment centers, and we've also announced that we'll have 15 or more sortation centers. The sortation centers helps us get closer to customers so that we can have fastest delivery speed as well as deliver on Sundays, which is the big deal for us in the US so we're very pleased to be able to do that.

On top of that, other investment areas that are certainly impacting our Q3 guidance is we like what we see on the content side, so video content, for example. We're ramping up the spend from Q2 to Q3 significantly. And then so be it also be a significant growth year over year.

Keep in mind we have two types of content. We have licensed content and we also have original content. A lot of you have probably seen a lot of the announcements that we've green lighted a number of pilots. We are going to be in heavy production on those pilots during -- sorry, in those series that a been green lit during Q3. We've also announced a number of pilots that we'll be in production on and so that original content, that's a portion of our total content, will be over $100 million in Q3.

Keep in mind that just as a reminder, that we do not capitalize that portion of our content -- of our original content. It's expenses incurred. So that's over $100 million in Q3, and again, that's ramped up considerably both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis. Other areas that we're investing in, certainly with the launch of some new devices, more recently over the past couple quarters between Fire phone and Fire TV and others.

Over time, we've invested in devices so that's certainly an area we are investing in. We're investing in a lot of different areas including geographic expansion. We talked about China on one of the earlier questions, but certainly India we are investing very heavily. We are seeing some very positive results there. The team's doing a fantastic job. We're also investing in other geographies as well, like Italy and Spain and others.

So again, we're encouraged by just the sheer magnitude of opportunities we have and we're investing in those opportunities.

MARK MAY: Appreciate the added detail.

OPERATOR: We'll move next to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Great. Thanks for the questions. First question on FBA. Any insights on the penetration of third-party sellers using FBA? Maybe you could comment just directionally. Is the number trending up or down? And separately, it's been less than a week but can you comment on early feedback to Kindle Unlimited by customers and publishers? Do you expect this to be the model for digital book consumption in the future? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of FBA, it's doing great. I can't provide any -- a specific percent. But it's continued really since the time we've launched, continued to increase as a percentage of total third-party units, and so the service has been -- has done very well. The team continues to work on making it even better on behalf of sellers and customers. In terms of Kindle Unlimited, it's very early but we're extremely pleased with what we see. There's been a great reaction to it, and we are pleased to offer that to customers.

OPERATOR: We go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great. Thanks. I was just wondering, you mentioned that you were happy with the results that you are seeing from the video content. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how that manifests itself, whether it's more Prime subscribers, whether it's more consumption of downloadable video content within the ecosystem.

And then, Tom, to the extent that you're talking about AWS volume increases on a year-over-year basis, can you give us a sense of how that may have trended over the course of the quarter as your AWS customers were able to sort of adapt to the price reduction in March?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of content, we've seen just more and more customers are streaming, more and more Prime members are streaming free content. We're seeing through our pipeline as customers join Prime, we're seeing that we have more and more customers taking free trials and then converting. Those customers are great customers.

In addition to streaming free content, they have great purchasing patterns. Doing a lot of cross shopping on physical products as well as converting to paid digital video and other digital products as well. We are very pleased with what we are seeing there, and when you look at the service that we have today it's improved dramatically over the past 12 to 24 months. We really think it's a great service and that's why we are investing in it.

In terms of AWS, there's not much I can help you with on that. But again, just to reiterate we saw very strong growth during Q2. And with usage growth rates close to 90% year-over-year for the quarter. And we're extremely happy with what we see there and the team is doing fantastic job and continuing to innovate on behalf of customers.

HEATH TERRY: Great. Thanks.

OPERATOR: We'll hear next from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. First on AWS. Just wondering your take on the competitive environment in public cloud. Has it intensified over the past 6 to 12 months and just given the investments in AWS, how do you view AWS's competitive positioning?

And then if you could just touch on the key drivers of EGM growth in North America and are those the same drivers of growth internationally or are there different drivers on North America versus International? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of AWS, there's not a lot in terms of talk to -- long-standing practice of not talking about other companies and what they're doing in environment. You know the team is certainly used to operating in a very competitive environment. They work hard to be able to afford lower prices for customers. That's something that is instilled in all of Amazon and it's something certainly that's instilled in our web services team.

And they're focused on what they do best which is innovating on behalf of customers, operating these services at the highest quality levels. And they'll continue to work on getting more efficient so that we can have great prices for customers. That's what the team's focused on and they're doing a great job. In terms of EGM growth, between North America and international, there's not a lot I can call out there. It has many different categories across many different geographies, many different ASINs, both first-party and third-party, so it's hard to comment.

The only thing I would call attention is the comment I made earlier around international growth rates related to EGM and that was the consumption tax increase in Japan that we saw a lead-in in Q1 were we saw very strong growth leading up to that point, and it softened after the rates went into effect. But other than that, there's not a lot to call out.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE: Thank you.

OPERATOR: We'll now go to Macquarie's Ben Schachter.

BENJAMIN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: When you mentioned that AWS is growing 90% year over year, what exactly is growing 90%? Is it storage? Is it something else? And then on the phone itself, are there any key differences in how we should be thinking about that piece of hardware versus other hardware you've done in the past where Jeff has discussed the notion of essentially wanting to break even.

And then just a follow-up on that, how are you modeling the impact of the phones on the P&L in 3Q? Is it going to be more or less than the original content initiative? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of AWS, it's really a aggregation of usage across all of our services year-over-year. I think that it's almost a proxy similar to unit growth on our retail business. It's a proxy to say how fast physical volume is growing, and so that's what it's a proxy for. In terms of the phone, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. We are extremely pleased to get it in customers' hands.

We think it's a premium product. And it also is -- it's also a great value too. You get a 32 gigabyte phone, premium product, one year free subscription to Prime, along with all the other features that I'm sure you've read about. So again, we're very pleased to get it to customers and start shipping, and customers have started to receive those today.

OPERATOR: And from William Blair, we'll go to Mark Miller.

MARK MILLER, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY: Good afternoon. Many investments one area looks like where you are getting a return is in the gross margin. If I take out AWS, it looks like you are up nearly 200 basis points. What are the drivers of that eCommerce margin increase? Are you seeing it primarily on the first-party margin expansion, and if so, why and how much is coming from third-party unit increase? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we don't actually focus on total company gross margins because of the mix of the business, we focus more on operating profit and obviously, ultimately free cash flow dollars. But in terms of things that would be impacting, you know, COGS as a percentage of revenue and that change to be helpful. You mentioned AWS is certainly having an impact there.

Our third-party business continues to have an impact there. We have offsets as we lower prices to customers having an impact there. Just mix of products, our various products and geographies has an impact on those results. Again, a large number of items that are impacting that.

OPERATOR: And Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch has our next question.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you. Tom, it might be a little bit of a disconnect when we've seen prior investment cycles such as distribution buildout or devices with say the Kindle reader, we did see the impact on units and accelerating growth in some of the categories. This time around, you've been investing for a couple years and I guess we are not really seeing the acceleration that some are looking for.

Maybe you could talk about what gives you confidence in investing in devices like the Fire TV and the phone and all the content you are doing and are seeing some underlying signs that say activity is picking up. Maybe you could walk through that.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Just a couple things to call out. One is when we look at our unit growth, you hear the 23% unit growth. Keep in mind that there are parts of our business that are not included in that unit growth. So when we talk about investing in web services and the usage growing close to 90%, that number is not included in the 23%, so that's obviously a large investment area for us that we are excited about that is not included in that.

The other is think about the base of business that we have versus where we were just a few years ago. And so you've seen very strong growth on the base that we have and we are excited to see that. And you know, so those of the things when we look at the opportunities that we're investing in, in terms of video you mentioned. We are seeing that certainly in the number of Prime members that are subscribing, and so that has some short-term impact but great long-term impact as we retain those Prime members.

And as they start to do more cross shopping over time, so it's more of a trailing -- we have a lot of investment in front of that demand, if you will. So those are some of the things that I would call out that maybe try to be helpful.

JUSTIN POST: Thank you.

OPERATOR: We move now to Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Okay, thank you very much. Going back to the $100 million in spend on the original content that you mentioned earlier, as the business -- as that part of the business grows, is there any reason to believe that the amount of spend on originals will go down? The assumption here is it will only go up. So is that $100 million a good level to work off of?

And then going back to the Fire phone, just trying to understand the strategy around the product longer term. Is it, again, just to try to further build the Amazon ecosystem with all its benefits or do you think this is a -- this could be a self-funded business? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the original content, you know, we're not giving guidance on the numbers going forward beyond Q3. We are very excited about what we see in the pilots that we had and the series we had. And so, you know, we are happy to green light the series that we've released that we've talked about in releases over the past few months. We're also happy you'll be seeing many new pilots, and so that's reflected in the over $100 million that I mentioned earlier.

So we're extremely excited on behalf of customers to be able to do that, and we think that the right thing to do. But in terms of what we do, in terms of spend beyond Q3, I can't comment on today. In terms of the Fire phone, we're very excited about it. You mentioned two different areas. One is can it exist on its own and whether it's part of our family, if you will, to help drive other usage and the answer is we certainly think it can be both.

So we think it can be a great product on its own. We're very excited to offer it to customers. It's very integrated into our -- certainly our various video services -- various digital services including, you know, video and games at our app store and ebooks and certainly Prime Music. So those are all very interesting things on behalf of customers.

It's also a great way to do physical shopping as well. So again, it's certainly integrated into our business as well.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: And Brian Nowak with SIG has our next question.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, SIG: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is around CPG, consumer packaged goods. I was wondering, Tom, can you talk to some learnings in CPG so far of what's working and what you think is still holding back faster CPG adoption. Do you think you need a same day delivery offering at this point for CPG kind of given Google and given the traditional retailers push into that category?

And then the second one, the close to 90% AWS usage growth, just to help us understand a bit more. What did that number look like in 2013? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the usage growth, that business is growing very, very fast. Beyond the data point, there's not a lot I can help you with. In terms of CPG, and this really relates to many of our categories. We are working on behalf of customers to provide fast delivery. It's something that we've improved on over the years and we're going to continue to work on. There's a number of different things we're working on.

One of the things that I mentioned earlier in the call is certainly sortation centers. That's an attempt on our side which we think we have in a small way and tested it and we've seen it the way to get product to customers even faster. So we're excited about that. It also helps us deliver on Sunday, which we think is great too, so those are the things that we're working on as well as others to help customers get product faster. We think that benefits CPG products as well as other products.

BRIAN NOWAK: Thanks.

OPERATOR: We'll move next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on that William Blair question about the gross margins, only because I know you don't focus on them and there's a lot of mixed factors that you correctly pointed out, but that's a record high gross margin for you, 30.7% ever. And it's in the context of a quarter in which AWS clearly came in because of the price cuts. And so there's something else that happened there that really caused that gross margin to gap up. Could you give us any color?

I understand a lot of puts and takes in there. But something must've happened that was unusual to have that kind of result with the slowing down AWS contribution. Thanks a lot, Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK: I apologize Mark, again. We don't focus a lot on gross margin as a business. Obviously, individual product lines we would look at gross margin but across the business, we don't, for the very reason you mentioned. There's a large mix impact. You have our web services business. You have our third-party business. You have a retail business. You have categories within retail.

There's a whole host of things that would impact that. And so that's why we don't focus on a total company basis. Certainly, on individual SKUs or ASINs as we call them, we certainly would look at it, individual subcategories. We would certainly look at it internally, but from a total company perspective, given the mix effects, we think it's much more appropriate to look at operating profit and free cash flow.

MARK MAHANEY: Okay.

OPERATOR: From ISI Group, we'll go to Greg Melich.

GREG MELICH, ANALYST, ISI GROUP: Thanks. It looked like revenue per active customer accelerated again this quarter, I think over 5%. It was running closer to 2% to 3% last year. Could you help us understand what's driving that? Whether it's Prime particularly or anything -- any color on that. And when you gave the Prime numbers, second quarter more sign-ups, whether that was a gross or a net number. Thanks a lot.

TOM SZKUTAK: The Prime was the net number so that's the net additions to total members. So again, we added net more Prime members in Q2 of this year versus Q2 last year, even with the price change. In terms of revenue per extra customer, there's not a lot I can say there. The one thing -- a few things to think about. One is certainly Prime customers buy more than non-Prime customers.

We're seeing great growth on Prime that's certainly having an impact on that number. Certainly, there'd be other factors to our web services business would be included in the numerator that you are talking about as well. And so those are factors you should be thinking about. But again, the biggest factor would certainly be in terms of looking at our retail business.

Prime is becoming much more meaningful. And that's also why we think about how do we make Prime better on behalf of those customers. We just like the long-term benefits that we see for those customers.

OPERATOR: Our final question today will be from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: Thanks Tom. One of your executives in the UK recently mentioned the Company's goal of reaching 1 billion different products available for sale on the site. I wonder if there is an expansion in selection beyond what we've seen recently that could help accelerate growth and related to that, are you still relatively agnostic in terms of the splits between first and third-party unit sales. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of selection, you know I would say nothing is new here. We are going to continue to add unique selection. That's something that we've been working extremely hard day in and day out over many years. We have a great team of people working on that and trying to make sure we get vast selection. So that is something we are pleased about.

In terms of the margins, you know, they do approximate each other. Obviously, there are some differences. Some of the third party will be used products so you shouldn't assume that a used product necessarily has the same contribution profit per unit as a new unit and things like that. But they're close approximates of those.

COLIN SEBASTIAN: All right. Thanks very much.

PHIL HARDIN: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Again, that we conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining us.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2014 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. But following the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. In addition, today's conference is being recorded. And now for opening remarks I will turn the conference over to the Senior Manager of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead sir.

   TD
DAVE FILDES, SENIOR MANAGER OF IR, AMAZON.COM INC: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2014 financial results conference call. Joining us is today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect Management's views as of today April 24, 2014 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM INC: Thanks, Dave. I'll begin with comments on our first-quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 26% to $5.35 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow increased to $1.49 billion. Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $3.85 billion.

We continue to make additional investments in support of business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital is 9%, up from 1%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 476 million shares compared with 471 million one year ago.

Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $19.74 billion, or 23% excluding the $10 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $5.47 billion, up 8%, or 8% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.02 billion, up 27%, or 27% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 23%.

Active customer accounts exceeded 244 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock based compensation. Cost of sales was $14.06 billion or 71.2% of revenue, compared with 73.4%. Fulfillment, Marketing, Tech and Content, and G&A combined was $5.18 billion, or 26.2% of sales, up approximately 240 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.24 billion or 11.3% of revenue, compared with 10.8%. Tech and Content was $1.82 billion or 9.2% of revenue, compared with 7.9%. Marketing was $843 million or 4.3% of revenue, compared with 3.8%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $11.86 billion. Media revenue grew 12% to $2.82 billion, or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $7.83 billion, representing 66% of North America revenues, up from 65%. Other revenue grew 60% to $1.2 billion. North America segment operating income increased 23% to $562 million, a 4.7% operating margin.

In the International segment, revenue grew 18% to $7.88 billion; adjusting for the $24 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 18%. Media revenue grew 4% to $2.64 billion or 4% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 27% to $5.19 billion, or 26% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 66% of international revenues, up from 61%. International segment operating loss was $60 million, compared with $16 million loss in the prior period.

CSOI increased 14% to $502 million, or 2.5% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 10%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense.

GAAP operating income decreased 19% to $146 million, or 0.7% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $73 million. GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with $82 million and $0.18 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $771 million year-over-year to $8.67 billion. Inventory increased 24% to $6.72 billion and inventory turns were 9.1, down from 9.5 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 19% to $10.59 billion and accounts payable days were 68, consistent with the prior year.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates could all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q2 2014 we expect net sales of between $18.1 billion and $19.8 billion, or growth of between 15% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 160 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $455 million loss and $55 million loss, compared to $79 million in income in the second quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $455 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $0 million and $400 million, compared to $409 million in the second quarter of 2013. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that Dave, let's move to questions.

DAVE FILDES: Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: Mark Miller, William Blair.

MARK MILLER, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY: Hi Tom, I was hoping you could maybe just lay out for us what do you think the main reasons are for the acceleration in growth here in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. And then I have a specific question on Prime Pantry. Is one of the motivations to get the customer on that program, it might make it easier to convert them to AmazonFresh? And if so, would you want to run this operation as a breakeven like you do with Kindle to enable a bigger business? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of growth we did -- we saw very solid growth, good growth in Q1, up 23% on a local currency basis. North America we saw similar growth rates in Q1 as we saw in Q4 of last year, as well as Q1 of last year all at 26%. In International we saw the growth accelerate a little bit on an exchange adjusted basis from 15% to 18% from Q4 to Q1.

But what we're really seeing is we're pleased with the overall fundamentals. We continue to add new customers, in-stocks continue to be healthy. Third-party units as a percentage of units are about 40%, so still very strong. FBA adoption continues to be strong around the world, continue to add new selection. We saw strong growth in many different areas including Web Services, and so again a lot of different areas contributed to the growth rate that we saw in Q1.

In terms of Prime Pantry, we just think it's an exciting option for Prime members. It's available only to Prime members, so that they can get their everyday non-bulk items in one box, and we think that's interesting for customers. And again, it's a great way that we can add the selection and have the selection for those customers.

OPERATOR: Aram Rubinson, Wolfe Research.

ARAM RUBINSON, ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH: Thanks for taking the question. On the famous drone interview that Jeff had with Charlie Rose, he said something that caught my attention, which was that every elasticity study that you do says that Amazon should be raising prices.

I have two questions around that. The first is does that equation also work in reverse? Meaning that if higher questions don't dampen demand, does it also mean that lower prices don't stimulate demand like they used to?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of pricing we've been very consistent. We want to offer great value to customers, and so we work very hard to make sure that we can offer and afford to offer great prices for customers. And so that's something that we've been working on very hard over the years. That's certainly one of the reasons why you've seen the growth rates that we've experienced along with getting closer to customers from a shipping perspective, making sure we have great in stocks and other service attributes.

In terms of price increases, we certainly have increased the price on Prime, but again that was after many years of not raising the price even though the cost of -- transportation costs certainly have gone up, and the fact that we have certainly added a lot of selection, going from a little over 1 million items in the first year to over 20 million items. So it's still an incredibly great value for customers, and that's why we did that. So again we're all about making sure we have great values for customers and we'll continue to do that.

ARAM RUBINSON: Okay, thanks for that.

OPERATOR: Carlos Kirjner, Sanford C Bernstein.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: I have two quick questions about AWS. First I think everyone would agree that AWS is a vast opportunity. So given how large the opportunity is, why is it that you are not hiring more people, launching more products, and growing faster? What are the limiting factors for growth of AWS?

Second, you have a long history of cutting prices for a few specific AWS products, but you did something somewhat unusual in late March when you cut prices across EC2 and S3 products in one shot. Why did you only cut your prices after Google cut theirs? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of AWS, the team is doing a fantastic job. We are adding a lot of resources. We've grown our employee base there dramatically over the years and continue to add people there. And that's the way we've been able to launch all the new services that we've had over the past several years. And we continue the pace of acceleration in terms of new things that we're doing is increasing and we've published a lot of statistics around that.

In terms of pricing, we think this is our 42nd price increase that we've had in AWS, sorry price decrease in AWS, and we're very excited on behalf of our customers to be able to do that. The team works very hard to be able to afford those lower prices, and we're excited to do that. And so in terms of the timing of when we launch these price decreases that come at different times and it happened to come in a presentation that we were giving around that time. But again we're very excited about the opportunity and we continue to invest in that business given the big opportunity that we have there.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Macquarie.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE EQUITIES RESEARCH: Can you walk us through the process on how you think about and how you model how much you're willing to pay for exclusive content such as video or video game content? And then another question, is it fair for us to assume that the business model of the Kindle Fire TV is similar to what Bezos has said regarding selling other hardware at roughly breakeven, and then making money only if consumers use it? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of video content, the team does a very nice job of various modeling, certainly we're trying to estimate what the usage is of all the content that we launch, and we have a number of different ways that we do that. We do have certainly for some of the content that we've been selling, both in terms of physical format as well as selling on the transactional side, we certainly see what the -- what those sales are -- what those unit sales are, so we have that as a benchmark.

We also have other models to look at that could help us guide to what we think the usage will be of those. But again, the team has done a nice job looking at different ways to model that, and I expect that we'll continue to refine that over time as well.

BEN SCHACHTER: Then on Kindle Fire TV?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Fire TV, I can't talk about the economics of the device itself. But what I can say is it's very early and we're extremely pleased with what we see in just the few weeks here, and the team certainly made what we think is a killer product. And we're -- the team is very hard trying to keep in stock on that product.

OPERATOR: Mark May, Citi.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITI: Wondering if you noticed any change in signups or conversions in the few weeks here since you've rolled out the Prime price increase for new customers, and if you could maybe comment on what may have contributed to the deceleration in year-on-year growth in Media sales in North America. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Prime, it's early but we're encouraged with what we see so far. Just over the last several weeks our Prime subscribers continue to grow week over week. New trials, the adoption of new trials again post the increase, are growing very nicely. So those customers accepting new trials is growing very fast.

We only have a few days of information related to conversion and we're encouraged by what we see there. So overall, we're very encouraged. The reason why is that customers we believe are responding to just a great service, and so we're continuously being reminded of that from customers in terms of the offering we have on the physical side, as well as the offerings that we have on the digital side as well, so very encouraged there.

In terms of the North American media, we did see a -- from a growth standpoint it's 13% year-over-year for North American Media. That compares to 14% in Q1 of last year. It is down a little bit sequentially from Q4, the Q4 keep in mind we do have video games and video consoles in that number in Q4, there's certainly a number of different factors. But that's certainly one that's impacting the Q4 numbers, and it's certainly seasonal as you would expect, but there's some great launches of consoles in Q4 that are impacting that number.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking the question. Tom, I was just hoping you could give us your view on units growth and how you think about that going forward. How important of a metrics it is, because we're seeing somewhat of a decoupling here as revenue and gross profit reaccelerated, but units obviously decelerated as media came down. Can you talk a little bit about that? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, as you mentioned unit growth was actually decelerated a little bit from Q4, and also from last year it was 23% year-over-year in Q1.

One thing to keep in mind is that our Web Services business is growing at a faster rate. We don't incorporate any units from AWS in that metric. But overall, you're right. We continue to from a growth standpoint we had a small acceleration of growth from Q4 to Q1 from a revenue standpoint, again on a local currency basis going from 22% to 23%. We're very pleased with a lot of the fundamentals that I talked about earlier that's impacting that growth rate.

Overall we're pleased and again, we think that we see a nice growth rate, and third-party units as a percentage of total units is 40%, which was consistent with what we saw last year. So third-party growth continues to be very strong as well.

OPERATOR: Brian Nowak, SIG.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, SIG: I have two. The first one, just Tom to go back to the unit question, even if we exclude North America and International Other from gross profit. Gross profit held in there pretty steady at 28%. Just kind of curious, is there anything that we should think about of why gross profit growth and unit growth is decoupling? And is unit growth a really good way to measure the health of the business?

And then the second one is on International Media. One of the factors you guys have flagged in the past holding back International Media is more limited local language content. Can you just help us better quantify the difference in English language digital content compared to foreign language? And what steps are your taking to improve that?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of -- I'll take the second part of the question first about International Media. The growth rate was 4% in the quarter, and as I've talked about in prior quarters, certainly one of the things that's happening is we see a conversion from physical to digital.

And for example in North America, we're now selling North America Media, we're now selling more digital units than physical units. So in the past 12 months we've sold more digital units than physical units. We're not at that point yet in International. And so certainly that's an opportunity for us as we look at growing International Media. It's again, it's certainly something that we're working very hard on and certainly a good opportunity for us.

In terms of unit growth, it's certainly just one measure that we thought has been helpful. And that's why we've continued to provide it. It is just one metric. We have many different metrics that we're sharing. But there's not much more I can add to that, but again it's a metric. Was there another -- was there a third part to the question?

BRIAN NOWAK: Are there any other puts and takes we should think about in units as we go throughout the year where there are tough compares or easy compares of units from a digital unit perspective or anything?

TOM SZKUTAK: There's not that I can think of at the minute. But just keep in mind when you think about our revenue growth, always be thinking about there's certainly a volume component. We have a third-party component. We have a mix component. We're continuously trying to lower prices for customers. All of those factor into the revenue growth rates that you see for each of the revenue metrics that we provide to you.

BRIAN NOWAK: Okay, great. Thanks.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Jefferies and Company.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Regarding Fulfillment, does it make sense for you to bring some of the components in-house? We've been hearing talk of your own fulfillment network. Can you make any comments on this? And just to follow up on your digital units point, can you comment on any impact of recent shifts in music and video consumption to subscription based models, from download to own on your Media business? Is that having any impact? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Fulfillment, there's not a lot I can comment on in terms of your specific question. What I would say though is we continue to work to be as we have over the years to become closer and closer to customers. And so we've certainly done that in a number of different ways, just the footprint we have from a fulfillment capacity standpoint enables us to be closer to customers and getting great selection even closer to customers.

So we continue to work. Certainly Prime was another way to get a faster delivery speed to customers, and so we'll continue to work on our capabilities there to make it even better over time. In terms of the digital units question, I apologize. There's not a lot I can comment in terms of your specific question there.

BRIAN PITZ: All right. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, BofA Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Tom, we look back at your model and we go back to '08 and '09 in the middle of a pretty bad global recession, you were able to put up 7.3% and 7.4% operating margins in Europe, I'm sorry International. And now it looks like you're losing money and maybe for the whole year.

Could you talk about some of the drivers that are driving the losses this quarter internationally? What the company's patience for losses are internationally. And when you come out of this, how your business will be different and what your margin outlook is for the International profits. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of what you're seeing in Q1 and you've been seeing this certainly for a few year period here is we're investing very heavily in International. And we're doing that in a number of different ways. Certainly from a geographic standpoint, we continue to invest in new geographies, and Italy and Spain were certainly the most recent. And you should assume we are investing in those geographies.

We continue to invest in China and certainly that's in investment mode. And then also as we've continued to grow in International, we've invested in terms of capacity, both fulfillment capacity as well as infrastructure capacity to support those.

What you saw, you will see some certainly variation over time in the period that you're talking about. We certainly had particularly coming out of -- going into late 2008 and also 2009 we had extra capacity globally. We still did continue to invest but not near the rates that we're investing now. And that's why you saw some of the results that you've seen. But again, one of the things that you see not only in International but in our total results is we continue to invest very heavily into the business because of the opportunities that we see.

JUSTIN POST: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Greg Melich, ISI Group.

GREG MELICH, ANALYST, ISI GROUP: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask on the decision process that you went through when raising the Prime membership fee. I know you talked about potentially doing $20 to $40. What factors did you look at in deciding on the $20? And related to that, with the deleveraging of shipment costs happening a little bit, was weather an impact on that or is that just the business and how it's trending?

TOM SZKUTAK: There was a number of different factors that we looked at in terms of when we looked at the price increase. But the biggest one is we had built -- we think we've built a great service, and we saw that just the particularly the transportation costs since inception had grown dramatically. We just hadn't done any price increase during that long time period, and that's really the big reason why we decided to do that.

We launched the program with over 1 million items and we have over 20 million items now. Customers are using that service in addition to having the transportation costs being higher, they're using that service more and that's really what led to it. And beyond that there's not a lot I can comment.

GREG MELICH: Just on the shipment costs deleveraging in the first quarter a little bit. Did weather or something else have an impact, or is that just the trend of the business given the growth rate of shipments?

TOM SZKUTAK: There's many different factors that go into that and certainly weather would have been one of those.

OPERATOR: Ronald Josey, JMP Securities.

ANDREW BOONE, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. This is Andrew on for Ron. A quick question around streaming volumes in UK and Germany now that Lovefilm is bundled with Prime. Do you have any comment?

TOM SZKUTAK: Unfortunately, it's probably a good question for future quarters, it's just so early. And again, what little data we have so far is very encouraging, but it's very early so I think that's a good question for future quarters.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great, thanks. Obviously, a lot of focus on pricing in AWS. But you're clearly still seeing accelerating growth despite those cuts. Could you provide some context on the volume side of that equation? Whether it's just growth in customers or workloads or some way to sort of frame the other side of things outside of just pricing in AWS.

TOM SZKUTAK: No, it's a good question and I think that's something we can certainly work on to try to be helpful. The price change, the most recent price change is certainly recent. And what we're commenting on is certainly the Q1 results.

But that's something that we'll think about and try to be helpful on that as we go forward, but certainly usage has been -- this is not something recent. Usage has been very, very strong. And as we've continued to lower prices over time, this is the 42nd price decrease that we've had and we've had great usage growth over time.

HEATH TERRY: Great. And just on the AWS side with the sort of nationalistic concerns that we're seeing around stored data, does that change at all the way that the AWS team is thinking about infrastructure needs for that business or the way that you might be thinking about capex.

TOM SZKUTAK: I think the best way to say it is, and hopefully this answers your question. The team focuses on many different aspects, but certainly the operational aspects of being up and running, being a very secure, reliable set of services, those are something the team is very focused on and spends a lot of time working on. And so beyond that, I'm not sure I can add to it.

HEATH TERRY: Great. Thanks Tom.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Cantor Fitzgerald.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Thank you very much. Two quick questions please. First, the HBO deal seems like a seminal event for Prime Video in terms of quality and probably the price bit as well. Is this the first of many potentially large deals you're intent on getting for the platform? Or was this more of an opportunistic transaction that just came your way. And second, just on the P&L can you just clarify where that $60 million in investment gains came from, please?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. The answer to the second question which is down below in Other relates to a gain primarily from LivingSocial. They sold their Korean business and that's reflected in that line item.

In terms of the content question. The way I would think about it is this. We've continually since we launched the service, we've continually added -- tried to add great content, and I think we've been pretty successful in doing that. And this is just another contract that we've launched into that's multi-year to do that. And we think it's -- we think it's a great for customers. We're extremely excited to offer this to customers. And we'll try to keep making the service even better over time.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Is exclusivity an important consideration for you now?

TOM SZKUTAK: There's a number of factors, certainly we have a number of different arrangements where we have exclusive content, and we think that's great for customers, and we've also supplemented with other content that's not exclusive.

And we're obviously as you know, we're working on original content as well that is exclusive. So those are the things that we're working on, and we see the customer response to all of those, and we're -- we like what we see.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Thanks.

OPERATOR: Scott Tilghman, B Riley.

SCOTT TILGHMAN, ANALYST, B. RILEY CARIS: Hi Tom, wanted to really ask two related questions. First following up on the international discussion from before. I was wondering if you could prioritize where the investments are going on the international side between fulfillment, media buildout, geography buildout, et cetera. And then related, I haven't seen any discussion on what's happening on the domestic fulfillment buildout this year. I was wondering if you could comment on that as well?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, in terms of the priority, I'm not sure what to add there, but I would say that we're investing heavily in China and we have been for some time, and certainly that's a factor. We're investing in new geographies, most notably Italy and Spain. We're investing in as I mentioned in fulfillment centers and infrastructure to support that growth. So again, not a lot to add there. The other part of your question?

SCOTT TILGHMAN: Let me ask it a different way, if you look at pricing, if you look at infrastructure, if you look at geography, is there one bucket that tends to trump the others?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, and again we've been pretty consistent how we've talked about it. Again, China you should assume, China is a big investment. In all of our geographies, not just international we're investing on behalf of customers in terms of lowering prices, and so that's having an impact. Volume is having an impact. We continue to invest in a fulfillment capacity not only for our retail customers, but also for third parties on behalf of Fulfillment By Amazon, and so we're making investments there. And the others that I mentioned.

SCOTT TILGHMAN: Fair enough. And on domestic fulfillment?

TOM SZKUTAK: Domestic fulfillment, as we have in past years, we'll continue to update you as we go throughout the year. I don't have any comments today given that we're just coming out of Q1, but we will be adding fulfillment capacity given the growth rates we're experiencing, and we'll update you as we go.

SCOTT TILGHMAN: Okay. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Eric Sheridan, UBS.

ERIC SHERIDAN, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks for taking the question. A question about your advertising business. There's been a lot of movement by Google to push PLAs as a product to sellers. I want to know longer term as you guys think about on both advertising on Amazon, and also to give out advertising in a way that would allow sellers to bring traffic back to their own websites that might avail themselves of Amazon's advertising data and user data to help enable those sales. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: I can't comment on what we might or might not do in the future. But the team has done a nice job from an advertising perspective and you can see those prominently on our various websites. We view it as another way certainly to help be able to afford lower prices for customers, and again the team has done a very nice job of monetizing those detailed pages to allow us to be able to do that.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks, Tom. Two questions, please. The International Media you talked about the I guess the digitization catchup or whatever of International Media. Could you break that down a little bit further? Are there certain categories, i.e., books versus videos, versus music, that one of those is dragging internationally.

What is it that needs to happen for that digital shift to occur? Do you need more rights, do you just need more devices in the market? What is the drag there?

And then in terms of the operating income guidance you're very consistent how you guided the last couple of years; it seems like you're guiding for more of a sequential decline in operating income in June quarter than you have the last two years. Is that just a different type of seasonality to the business, or are there new near-term investments that you're making in the June quarter? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the second part of the question related to the guidance, what's reflected in the Q2 guidance has many different factors but we are investing. I mentioned a number of different investments that we're making in International, which related to Q1, also related to Q2. We're investing in content. We're investing in our Web Services business, both from a new services as well as pricing.

So again, we're investing in a lot of different areas across the company. I'm sure there's a number that I'm not mentioning, so again we're investing. So that's really what you're seeing in the range of guidance that we see in Q2.

In terms of International Media, we continue to make progress there on our conversion from physical to digital. But we're just not where we are in North America. And it's in many different categories and we'll continue to work on that. And certainly some of the things that you see related to video in Europe, certainly trying to address that part of that. So again we'll continue to work on the various pieces of that for our International business and look forward to doing that.

MARK MAHANEY: Thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Hey, guys. If you don't mind I'll beat the dead horse on the international question. But specifically around China, can you just give us an update on the overall strategy for China? Are the levels of investments going into the country accelerating or are they just stable? And then what kinds of milestones in terms of market share or customer adoption do you guys track to identify success or return on that investment? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In China, we're investing a lot and trying to grow the business there. We're certainly investing in our fulfillment -- we have been investing in our fulfillment network to get even closer to customers. We're doing a lot on the retail basics as we've done in other geographies, making sure that we have great in-stock availability. We've making sure that we have had a unique selection.

So those are -- a lot of the things that we've done, making sure that we have the right pricing in place on behalf of customers. Making sure that our service levels are where we need them to be.

So those are the things we continue to work on in China. It's a very large opportunity. And we continue to work hard. Is it a large investment? Yes, it is. And that investment has certainly increased over the past several years.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, Robert Baird and Company.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: First just one clarification on the AWS question. Given the comments that customers would see hundreds of millions of dollars of savings in Q2 from the price cuts, I just want to understand or clarify if we should be expecting moderating growth rate in the other segments, at least temporarily?

And then lastly just Amazon's position on the ability of ISPs to add a toll for fastlane network access. Is this a scenario a situation that would change the company's approach or strategy with regards to video or is this more of a non-factor for you guys? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the just clarification in Jeff's quote, he mentions that customers will be saving hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several months alone. He didn't say specifically to second quarter. So certainly that's impacting second quarter, and it's reflected in the guidance that you're seeing there. But again, we're very happy to do that on behalf of our AWS customers.

We've done many different price decreases over time and we think that's great on behalf of customers, and we think our team's and we're positioned very well in that business, and we'll continue to invest in that given the large opportunity that we have there. In terms of your other question, there's not really a lot I can comment there.

OPERATOR: And ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we only have time for one more question which will come from Kerry Rice with Needham and Company.

KERRY RICE, ANALYST, NEEDHAM & COMPANY: Just a couple questions. One on customer adds, you didn't add as many new customer accounts as you did in Q1 2013. And so I assume based on your comments that wasn't related to the price increase around Prime, and so I don't know if you can add any context there.

And then the second question is just around Mobile. Obviously, the mobilization throughout the world is an important trend and you guys haven't talked a lot about it. Wonder if you can give us any context around your strategy there or any metrics.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Prime, Prime again, over the year-over-year is growing very rapidly. And then also week over week as we look at the metrics over the last several weeks, continues to grow week-over-week. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there.

In terms of Mobile, it's certainly a tailwind for our business. We have a number of different things that we're working on for mobile. And we continue to make it easier and easier for customers to shop from a mobile perspective. Our traffic continues to increase from a mobile perspective, and we're excited about what we see there. And we continue trying to find ways to make that even better from an experience standpoint for our customers.

DAVE FILDES: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: And again, ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Once again, we do thank you all for your participation.

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Well, good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2013 financial results teleconference.

   TD
(Operator Instructions)

Today's conference is also being recorded.

Now for opening remarks, I will turn the call over to the Senior Manager of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead, sir.

DAVE FILDES, SENIOR MANAGER, IR, AMAZON.COM INC: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2013 financial results conference call.

Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 30, 2014 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release, and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM INC: Thanks, Dave.

I will begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 31% to $5.47 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $2.03 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $3.44 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations, and investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services.

Return on invested capital was 13%, up from 4%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock, and stock-based awards outstanding was 476 million shares, compared with 470 million shares one year ago.

Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $25.59 billion, or 22% excluding the $258 million unfavorable impact from the year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $7.23 billion, up 11% or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $17.13 billion, up 23% or 24% excluding foreign exchange.

Worldwide EGM increased to 67% of worldwide sales, up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 25%. Active customer accounts exceeded 237 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units.

Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $18.81 billion, or 73.5% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined were $5.9 billion or 23.1% of sales, up approximately 210 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.84 billion or 11.1% of revenue, compared with 10.3%. Tech and Content was $1.69 billion, or 6.6% of revenue, compared with 5.7%. Marketing was $1.11 billion or 4.3% of revenue, compared with 3.9%.

Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation, or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment revenue grew 26% to $15.33 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $3.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 25% to $10.65 billion, representing 69% of North America revenues, down from 70%. Other revenue grew 52% to $1.17 billion.

North America segment operating income increased 19% to $725 million, a 4.7% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 13% to $10.26 billion. Adjusting for the $244 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 15%. Media revenue grew 3% to $3.71 billion, or 6% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenues grew 19% to $6.48 billion, or 21% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 63% of International revenues, up from 60%.

International segment operating income increased 116% to $151 million, a 1.5% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income increased 119%.

CSOI increased 29% to $876 million or 3.4% of revenue, up approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, CSOI increased 28%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased 26% to $510 million, or 2% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $179 million, resulting in a 40% tax rate for the quarter, and a 32% rate for the full-year of 2013. GAAP net income was $239 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared with $97 million and $0.21 per diluted share.

Now I will discuss our full year results. Revenue grew 22% to $74.45 billion, or 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 28% to $44.52 billion, and International revenue grew 14% to $29.94 billion, or 19% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, increased 20% to $1.99 billion, or 21% excluding the unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, and the operating margin was 2.7%, consistent with the prior year. GAAP operating income increased 10% to $745 million or 1% of net sales.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1 billion year-over-year to $12.45 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $7.41 billion, and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.3 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 14% to $15.13 billion. Accounts payable days decreased to 74, from 76 in the prior year.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance, are the order trends that we have seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we have described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intracompany balances, and foreign currencies amongst those subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructuring, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they been recently.

For Q1 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.2 billion and $19.9 billion, or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $200 million loss and $200 million income, compared with $181 million income in the first quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $150 million and $550 million, compared with $441 million in the first quarter of 2013.

We launched Prime in the US nine years ago, with free, unlimited two-day shipping on 1 million items, and an annual membership price of $79. Today Prime selection has grown to over 19 million items. Even as fuel and transportation costs have increased, the $79 price has remained the same. We know that customers love Prime, as their usage of the shipping benefit has increased dramatically since launch. On a per customer basis, Prime members are ordering more items, across more categories, with free two-day shipping than ever before.

With the increased cost of fuel and transportation, as well as the increased usage among Prime members, we are considering increasing the price of Prime between $20 to $40 in the US. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks. And with that, Dave let's move to questions.

DAVE FILDES: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: Absolutely, Mr. Fildes.

(Operator Instructions)

Our first question will come from Mark May with Citi.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITI: Thanks for taking my questions. The unit growth in the quarter, I believe, was around 25%, which was a deceleration, notable versus the last couple of quarters, I believe the comp even got a little easier. Any -- can you give, provide any color as to the dynamics in the quarter that may have drove that?

And then, try to get a sense of how to think about the magnitude of the Prime price increase? Maybe if you could give us a sense of the base of subscribers that that would be applied to? And then lastly, on shipping demand, is there anything that Amazon will do differently next holiday season to try to smooth out the pace of demand late in the holiday shopping season?

TOM SZKUTAK: First, the unit growth, you are right. It was 25% year-over-year, it is a deceleration, a small deceleration from the last couple quarters. Keep in mind, that it is our -- certainly, our biggest quarter, the most seasonal. And so, both from a revenue and from a unit standpoint, you saw a deceleration from Q3 to Q4 of 2012 also. And so, we saw a deceleration, not of the same magnitude we saw back in 2012, from Q3 to Q4. But if you take a look at the total growth, it is 25% on a unit basis, 22% ex exchange on a revenue basis.

We saw very good growth in North America, up 26%. This is again, on a revenue basis. It is down sequentially a little bit in the last couple quarters, but certainly up from Q4 last year where we grew 23%. In the International, the revenue was up about 15% ex exchange. If you look at the pieces, certainly one of the biggest things you are seeing is -- if you look at the Media growth, and our digital categories within Media and International it is growing very fast.

But as we have been talking about for quite some time, certainly a shift going from physical to digital. You see that reflected in our North America Media growth rates. The reason why you don't see it as much in our International is because we are at the very early stages of that. So that is what you are seeing, in terms of the differential up, certainly one of the key differentials between the International Media growth rate, and the North America growth rate. Also keep in mind, in other revenue, the AWS revenue which is growing very fast, is recorded in the North America segment.

In terms of the Prime -- in terms of impact, I am sorry, I can't help you with the impact on the US. What we have said is, globally, we have tens of millions of customers, and we certainly have been offering Prime in the US longer than International. And both segments are growing very fast from a Prime perspective, if that is helpful. And then, from a customer standpoint during Q4, we worked very hard on behalf of customers to make sure that we can service them. I think the team did a very nice job. We will continue to work on that to get even better in future quarters, and in future Q4's going forward.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.

ROBERT COOLBRITH, ANALYST, CRT CAPITAL: Good afternoon. This is actually Robert on the call for Neil. A couple questions. If you could maybe talk a little bit about the impact of refunds or incentives given to customers to make up for some of the goods that arrived late in the holiday season? Also on Prime, with respect to the increase, would you consider phasing that in, applying to perhaps just the new members at first? And also, would you consider giving an installment option to maybe soften the blow? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes in terms of the refunds, we did give some in the form of gift certificates, as well as refunding some shipping fees where fees were incurred by customers -- for that subset of customers who were impacted. So that is reflected in the Q4 results that you see today.

And in terms of details of how we would roll out the Prime price increase that we are considering, you will have to wait on that. But certainly, it is, as I have mentioned it is something that we haven't had any increase in the nine years. Customers certainly love Prime. The available units for shipment have grown dramatically from 1 million to over 19 million. Over the last nine years, we haven't had any price increase.

Customer usage on a per customer basis has gone up pretty dramatically, given the selection and the convenience of the service. So that is why we are considering -- of course, during this nine year period, shipping costs have gone up a lot. Fuel costs have gone up a lot. So that is certainly the basis for us taking a look at it. But in terms of the details, we will be back when we make those decisions back to customers.

OPERATOR: Moving on to Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JP MORGAN: Great, thanks for taking the question. Just want to follow-up on Prime as well, and was hoping, Tom, that you could give us some color on how newer Prime members -- you have obviously added a lot of them over the recent quarters, but how newer cohorts of Prime members act relative to older cohorts? And in particular, if they convert sort of as quickly, and if they are spending on a similar kind of early trajectory as your more tenured Prime members? And then also, can you just comment on the -- I believe the constrained sign-ups in 4Q on Prime? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of details, I can't really give you a lot of color on the more recent versus the Prime members who have been with us for a long time, except to say that there is a lot of similarities, in terms of what we are seeing. So in other words, customers, when we launched Prime nine years ago, one of the things that we hoped for, was customers would do a lot more cross-shopping, that they would buy more from us. And we are seeing that trend also in more recent Prime additions again. So we are -- the program is growing very fast. We are very, very pleased with it, and we think it is great for the business as we look forward as well. In terms of -- what was the second part of the question again?

DOUGLAS ANMUTH: 4Q, I think you talked about sign-ups being constrained in the quarter?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, it -- again, we had very fast growth. We put a couple statistics out in our holiday, our release on the 26th, that you can refer to. But we had very strong growth, and we -- it did constrain it a bit, and customers like it. And again, there is a lot of demand for the service, and we are going to continue to make sure that we can satisfy customers there. And we thought it was appropriate to do so, to do that during Q4.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH: Thank you.

OPERATOR: We will move on to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi, Tom. A couple questions starting with -- I will continue the trend with Prime questions first. You mentioned higher shipping costs being a driver of potentially higher prices in the US. The US Prime service is also the only one that has Kindle Lending Library and video, and was just wondering if potentially those additional services have led you to think about increasing price as well, to potentially further bolster either or both?

And then secondly, International CSOI has been on a glide path lower over the last few years. And as has that happened, the organic International growth rate has moderated during the same period. And I am just wondering, going back to the decision to embark on the International investment cycle, if you anticipated the current revenue growth rate that you are experiencing? And if not, where are the areas in the business where you could point to, that we would begin to see growth that is not yet evident in International business? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the first part, we have added a lot of new services to Prime, beyond our -- the shipping benefits. You mentioned Kindle Owners' Lending Library, certainly video, Prime Instant Video, we are investing very heavily, and so those are certainly costly. Those aren't the reasons for the price increase that we are contemplating. Those are -- that decision again is just based on, we haven't done a price increase in nine years. Shipping costs have gone up, if you look back very considerably over the nine-year period. Customers like the service. They are using it a lot more. We have a lot more selection. They are using it a lot more. And so, that is the reason why we are looking at the increase.

In terms of International growth -- we -- the growth was solid, with revenue ex exchange at 15%. The unit growth was considerably faster than that, primarily because third-party growth was very strong, and certainly FBA is a component of that. And when you think about the capacity that we built it for, not only for our retail, but also for our third-parties, and we are able to offer our FBA items through Prime as well. So we are very happy with the capacity that we have built across the world, including our International operations, and that is reflected in the results that you are seeing. Certainly, one of the reasons why you are seeing the growth of operating income, up over 100% in Q4 for International, is because of the mix of third-party, certainly helping that. So it is a combination of a number of factors, but certainly that is one that is a significant call out.

SCOTT DEVITT: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Great. A couple things, I was hoping you could talk about your initiatives with AmazonFresh, what you are seeing in the Bay Area, and Los Angeles so far? Are you seeing more units per customer? And then, maybe talk a little bit about the International Kindle Stores. Could you start to see better Media results, as you have built out that infrastructure? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of Fresh in LA and the Bay Area, it is very, very early. We like what we see. Customers like the service. There has been good adoption. There has been good conversion from the Prime trials. And so, we are very pleased with what we are seeing there. But it is still very early. And so, we will have to -- you will have to stay tuned on that one. But again, it is very early, but we like what we see.

In terms of International Kindle Stores, yes, absolutely -- we are, to be very clear, if you look at the Kindle content growth in Q4 in International, it is very strong. It is just again, we are at the early stages of this cycle, from physical to digital. So the growth rate is very strong, and we saw similar type things, when we look back at the US, in terms of trends. But it is, again, it is -- we are at the earlier part of the cycle on that conversion.

JUSTIN POST: Great. Thank you.

OPERATOR: We will now hear from Brian Nowak with Susquehanna.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP: Thanks. It looks like 1P gross margins, ex shipping expanded nicely year-on-year again. I was wondering if you could talk to some of the margins of -- what some of the drivers of 1P gross profitability getting better? And how should we think about the sustainability of that over time? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: We are not breaking out the first party margins, if you will. So I can't talk to the specifics of that. But our retail business is very good, it -- the combination of our retail business and our third-party business on our platform works for us. We think it is very important have both offerings for a number of reasons.

One is, from a customer experience standpoint, we like the fact the customers come to our detail pages on our respective websites around the world, and they see competitive offerings. They know that we are very excited about making sure we get great values for customers, and we price our products appropriately, competitively low. And so, having third parties on our website certainly helps do that. It also adds additional selection that we don't have.

And so, it is a combination of being able to make sure we have a competitive marketplace, as well as add great, unique selection from both retail offerings and third-parties that make it work. And so, that is why we don't talk necessarily about first-party or third-party in terms of margins, but it is the combination of those working together on a platform that makes it work.

BRIAN NOWAK: Thank you.

OPERATOR: We will now hear from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great. Thank you. I have a couple questions, with the potential price change of Prime in US, would Amazon consider offering Prime Instant Video separately? And in terms of Prime Instant Video, can you discuss the change in marketing spend for the service on a year-over-year basis, 4Q 2013 versus 4Q 2012? And then, just in the North American electronics and other goods segment, could you call out any particular categories that drove the growth? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Prime, there is not a lot I can help you with there. We certainly have -- it is a great offering for customers. I wouldn't speculate what we would do or not do, going forward. But we like the service that we have. We continue to invest in our Prime offering, and it comes in a number of different forms. We will continue to add unique selection that is Prime eligible. We have a great pattern of doing that over the nine-year period.

We have also offered other services as you mentioned, in terms of Prime Instant Video, as well as Kindle Owners' Lending Library. So it is a great value for customers, and we plan on keeping that a great value for customers, even with the price increase that we are considering in the US.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE: Great, thanks. And the North American and electronics and other goods segment, just wondering if there are any particular categories that drove the growth?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, it was very broad in terms of growth. We are very fortunate that we saw very good growth across many different categories. Certainly, if you call out the Softline categories, were very strong. Consumables were very strong, again a number of different areas, those certainly, a few call outs.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets has the next question.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Yes. I will just stick with the EGM category in North America. It looked to us like it decelerated relatively sharply. I thought you were going to call out some areas of weakness there. Is there anything that caused that growth rate you would call out, that caused growth rate to decelerate on an easy comp? And then, Tom, did you want to call out anything related to weather or UPS, or did you think that those impacts were immaterial to the business in the quarter? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, again, if you look at -- you were talking about -- I think your question was around EGM in North America? A good 25%, you are right, it did decelerate from Q3. Keep in mind that a number of the categories within EGM, there is certainly a seasonal impact. If you look back to last year, Q4, our growth rate in North America was 24%. So we actually saw an acceleration from Q4 last year to Q4 this year, up slightly. And so, that is -- and then, sorry, Mark, the second part of your question was related to?

MARK MAHANEY: Did you want to call out anything related to weather and UPS?

TOM SZKUTAK: No. I mean, I think certainly some of the UPS issues were documented in the press, and from our standpoint, our team did a very good job of serving customers. We did have the issue that you are describing. But again, we will continue to work on behalf of customers, to make sure we improve that experience over time, where we didn't serve them well. We certainly did give some GCs to customers. We also reimbursed them for shipping costs, where they incurred that, and we will continue to make that better and better for customers over time.

MARK MAHANEY: Thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: Moving on to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein Capital

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: Thank you. Two quick questions. Your CapEx was just slightly higher than last year same period if you correct for the real estate purchase, even though the business overall grew 22%, and you said AWS grew very fast. Does this relative decrease in CapEx signal an expectation that AWS is going to grow slower?

And secondly on, again the Prime price increase, if you have tens of millions of Prime users that increasing price at least $20 with no incremental expense. That's quite a good chunk of money. Do have specific plans to reinvest that money? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: The first part of your question, do we expect -- is this is an indication that AWS is slowing down? No, it is not. Actually, we are very pleased with the AWS business. It is growing very fast. The team is doing a fantastic job, from a product and service standpoint, and we are very excited about that business. So I wouldn't form any opinions about what about what CapEx might be in the future, related to the growth rates in AWS. It is going very, very well.

And then, the price increase on Prime, anything that we would invest would be an independent decision from that again. I think in the in opening remarks, I talked about the rationale as to why, and that is really what is driving that decision. And then, our investment decisions would be independent of that.

OPERATOR: Greg Melich with the ISI Group has the next question.

GREG MELICH, ANALYST, ISI GROUP: Thanks, Tom. Going back to Prime, as you consider the price increase, do you think the brand is such that you would be willing to price-tailor it or tier it, based on the value that is offered, and the sort of services you provide to certain customers? And then second, on the categories, I believe you called out a few quarters earlier, that Clothing in particular was one, and third-party Clothing had picked up a lot. Did you see that this holiday, just given the importance of that core category in the season?

TOM SZKUTAK: I will take the second part first. Softlines was very strong in Q4, which Clothing is a piece of that. And in terms of tiers on Prime, I wouldn't speculate on what we might or might not do in the future. But we like the Prime program, where we have invested very heavily in it. We continue -- you should expect us to continue to make it even better over time.

GREG MELICH: There is no prohibition to that, but you sort of like it the way it is?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we like it the way it is. But again, we are -- if you look back at what we have done -- can't speculate what we might do going forward. But certainly, we have had in the US Prime in place for nine years. We have added massive selection during that time period.

We have also added, this is on the physical side -- and we have also added digital content as well to the service in the US, with Kindle Owners' Lending Library, as well as Prime Instant Video. And so, it is a great value for our customers. We see the customers love it, and we are going to continue to try to make that even better for customers over time.

OPERATOR: Moving on to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.

RONALD JOSEY, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to follow-up on AWS, and talk a little bit on pricing. And while it is certainly coming down, and efficiency has improved. But I believe AWS is sold in hour increments. I think Google's complete solution is sold on a per minute of use. So I was wondering if you thought about maybe changing the way AWS is charged to maybe per minute?

And then a quick follow-up on just fulfillment centers. If you could just remind us what you ended the year with, and if you have any plans for this year? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms -- I will take the second part first. The fulfillment centers, we opened seven on a net basis. So that is the net adds, and but on a -- if you take that as a percentage of our total fulfillment centers, you will get a number. But our square footage actually grew at quite a bit faster rate than that. Keep in mind that -- I think we have talked about in previous calls, we did have some smaller, older facilities that we consolidated into larger ones. And so, it is a net seven, and again the square footage growth is higher than that.

In terms of pricing on AWS, the team is doing a fantastic job, looking at the best way to run that part of our business. And I wouldn't want to speculate what they would or wouldn't do related pricing. But they are certainly making sure they are have -- offer great services to customers, and they are great values to customers as well, and we are very excited about that part of the business.

RONALD JOSEY: Thank you.

OPERATOR: We will now hear from Chad Bartley with Pacific Crest.

CHAD BARTLEY, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES: Hi, thank you. Two quick questions, how much of the slowdown in revenue and unit growth was a function of the shorter shopping season in Q4? And then in terms of raising the price on Prime, how much of that might be based on customers reaction behavior, after recently raising the threshold for free shipping to $35?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the shorter period for shopping, it is hard to tell. Honestly, it is hard to know. It definitely was a shorter period from post-Thanksgiving to the holiday, and but again, hard to know. And then in terms of your -- sorry, the other part of your question?

CHAD BARTLEY: I am curious if the potential price increase on Prime, and your confidence in doing that, and that it wouldn't impact the adoption of Prime, how much of that is tied to the early results of raising the shipper saving threshold to $35 from $25?

TOM SZKUTAK: They were independent decisions. They weren't related.

CHAD BARTLEY: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thomas Forte with Telsey Advisory Group has the next question.

TOM FORTE, ANALYST, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So when we think about shipping costs, I know you are talking about raising the rate on Prime. But you just indicated that you added seven fulfillment centers in 2013 on a net basis. As you get closer to the consumer, and you shorten the ship miles, how should we think about the benefit on shipping expenses, from just having more fulfillment centers closer to the consumer?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. There is no question that we get -- as we grow our footprint, we get closer and closer to customers with additional selection. And that has certainly helped us not raise prices, or look at raising prices before this. And so, certainly we will continue to roll out our footprint. We will try to make -- we are trying to make our network as efficient as possible.

And that is -- even with this price increase that we are looking at, it still enables us to make sure we that have Prime at a great value to customers. And that is something that is very important to us, because we know it is very important to our customers.

TOM FORTE: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Moving on to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Great, thanks. In terms of digital content, how are exclusive titles and original series driving user growth in Prime memberships? And any color on what kind of engagement dynamics you are seeing across the different platforms? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Hello? Could you repeat the question, please?

BRIAN PITZ: Sure. In terms of digital content, I am just trying to figure out how some of your exclusive content and titles are driving user growth in Prime memberships? And any color just on, what type of engagement you are seeing across the different platforms via PC, tablet, et cetera?

TOM SZKUTAK: We are seeing customers like the digital content. We are seeing great engagement. We are not breaking out -- in terms of the form, but again, we are seeing great engagement. We do track very closely the Prime customers that come from free trials, for example, for -- that come through the pipeline for digital content from a free trials standpoint. We track those conversions, and we see that is growing very nicely.

We do look at customers that use our Prime Instant Video, how they -- what their shopping patterns look like outside of digital content? Do they buy, excuse me, beyond the free content that we have on there? Do they buy more digital content? And certainly, we are seen nice growth in digital content because of that, because they do. They also do a lot of shopping in physical categories as well. So those things we are tracking very closely. And it is a great pipeline for us, as customers look at the total value proposition for Prime, including digital content.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs has the next question.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great, thanks. Tom, you mentioned the strong growth in AWS. Looking at the deceleration in the North America and other line, how should investors think about the relative growth of AWS versus the advertising and financial partnership that are -- that make up the rest of that segment? And then, just on the Fresh with LA and San Francisco's fulfillment centers carrying a number of non-perishable SKUs, what does Fresh do for your same-day fulfillment capabilities in those markets?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of AWS, I think the best way to think about it is, a number of things that are in other, other than AWS can be lumpy. And you should assume when you look at the North America growth for Q4, that our AWS revenue is growing at a faster rate than other. And then in terms of Fresh, it certainly, when you look at those two, look at the new offerings that we have in the Bay Area and in the LA area, it is certainly helping our same-day delivery, and they work hand-in-hand. So in other words, we have -- we have increased our capability, both for Fresh, as well as for our non-Fresh part of our business there in those locations.

BRIAN PITZ: Great. Thank you.

OPERATOR: We will now hear from Yousef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Thank you very much. Two questions, please. First, have you seen any impacts from the use -- from the rise of the Google's PLA this quarter? And second, are you using Kiva's technology in the -- your food distribution centers, particularly for perishables -- for perishables, excuse me? Our understanding that it is not optimized for that, but is that true? And if not, are there any other solutions outside of Amazon that do that optimally? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Kiva, it is very early, we have a -- we are early in our installations there. That is really all I can say. We have it in a few facilities. It is going very well, very pleased with having Kiva as part of the Amazon family, if you will, and we are excited about the opportunity that brings us going forward.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: And on the PLAs?

TOM SZKUTAK: I can't comment.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Okay, thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks, Tom. Just a quick high-level question. So consumers in smartphone markets are spending about half their time on mobile these days, and a lot of that is coming off of PC. And I am sure that is a great kind of new customer acquisition channel for you.

But in terms of existing Amazon customers, are you seeing purchase frequency for physical products go up, because of having phones with you all day? Or is it just swapping off of PC and into these newer channels? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: I kind of view -- just having the more connected devices is just a tailwind for our business, and it is additive. It is certainly helping our business grow. So whether that is phones or tablets, it is just a tailwind for our business, and we think it will continue to be so. So it is -- customers will certainly still purchase from their desktop or their laptop. And so, the tablet and mobile will not be completely additive, but it will certainly be a tailwind for our business. It is just, anytime customers have easier access to be able to purchase, that is good for us.

OPERATOR: Now ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: Good afternoon. Could you just remind us, on just -- from a kind of a high-level philosophy, the trade-off between revenue growth and earnings? We -- I think investors typically think that you see this as very -- all of your markets as nascent, and profitability is kind of a distant thought. Is that still the case? And any guidance in terms of how to think about that over the next 2, 5, 10 years? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. We track a lot of our investments on a discrete basis as best we can. We are looking to maximize -- can you hear me okay?

GENE MUNSTER: Yes.

TOM SZKUTAK: We are looking to maximize free cash flow in those investments over time. And so, we have some investments that certainly start to pay off and become profitable in a three to five year period. We have others that have been a bit longer. But again, we are monitoring those investments very carefully. Our goal is to maximize free cash flow for investors over time. That is clearly our goal, and that is something that we are working towards.

All that being said, we are investing a lot of the business right now. You can see that when you look at our results. And the reason why we are doing that is because of the very large opportunities that we see. And we do go in cycles, as you have seen in our historical results. From time to time, we will pull back to make sure the model is working, and we have done that. And I am sure you will see that going forward at times as well. But again, we are focused on making sure that we have a great customer experience, and we maximize free cash flow over the long-term.

GENE MUNSTER: Got it. Thank you.

DAVE FILDES: Great, thanks, Tom. Thank you all for joining us on the call today, and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you all for your participation.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com third-quarter 2013 financial results teleconference.

   TD
(Operator Instructions)

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead, sir.

SEAN BOYLE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 24, 2013, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as our metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our third-quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 48% to $4.98 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 63% to $388 million. Trailing 12 month capital expenditures were $4.59 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space as well as property for our development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments as part of our continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon web services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

Return on invested capital was 3% down from 10%. ROIC is TTM pre-cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 475 million shares compared with 469 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 24% to $17.09 billion or 26% excluding the $332 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take it advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $5.03 billion, up 9% or 13% excluding foreign exchange.

EGM revenue increased to $11.05 billion, up 29% or 31% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up from 62%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts exceeded $224 million, worldwide active seller accounts more than $2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $12.37 billion or 72.3% of revenue compared with 74.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology, and content, and G&A combined was $4.46 billion or 26.1% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $1.96 billion or 11.5% of revenue compared with 10.5%. Technical content was $1.58 billion or 9.2% of revenue compared with 7.8%. Marketing was $671 million or 3.9% of revenue compared with 3.8%.

Now we will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 31% to $10.3 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $2.61 billion. EGM revenue grew 33% to $6.73 billion representing 65% of North America, revenues up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 1% to $295 million, a 2.9% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 15% to $6.79 billion. Adjusting for the $327 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue increased 2% to $2.42 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 23% to $4.32 billion or 28% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 64% of international revenues, up from 59%.

International segment operating loss was $28 million, compared to a $59 million loss in the prior period. Consolidated segment operating income increased 15% to $267 million or 1.6% of revenue, down approximately 10 basis points year over year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 18%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $25 million compared to a $28 million loss in the prior year period. Our income tax benefit was $12 million. GAAP net loss was $41 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared with net loss of $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share. The third quarter 2012 included a loss of $169 million or $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity method share of losses reported by LivingSocial primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets including goodwill. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.44 billion year over year to $7.69 billion. Inventory increased 20% to $607 billion and inventory turns were 9.2, down from 9.7 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in stock globals, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 20% to $10.04 billion and accounts payable days was 75, consistent with the prior year.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances from foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.

Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, report any further revisions to stock based compensation estimates, and net foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q4 2013, we expect net sales of between $23.5 billion and $26.5 billion or growth between 10% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 125 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss could be between a $500 million loss and $500 million in income compared to $405 million income in the fourth quarter 2012. This includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based composition and other expense to be between a $150 million loss and $850 million income compared to $678 million income in fourth quarter 2012. We remain headstrong focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.

SEAN BOYLE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator would you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Ben Schachter, Macquarie.

BENJAMIN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: On the press release it says that you signed up millions of new Prime members. I believe if you read it, it says that it happened in the last 90 days. I wonder if you ever commented on a time period like that before. Is that a normal run rate to add millions of Prime users in 90 days or is it something special in this quarter that drove Prime? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: I do not recall if we've actually given a 90 period before. I do not believe that we have. In terms of beyond that, there's not a -- that I can add to that. We are very excited. Prime is growing very fast. I am very excited for the service that we offer customers both in terms of physical and digital goods. So it is exciting and that is why we put it in there today in the release.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Two if I could. First on the Kindle family. It seems like the timing of device launches, on the eBook library size, and local language content could be drivers of different levels of penetration in digital media in the US relative to what you've been able to obtain outside the US to date. I was wondering if there was anything else notable that you would highlight that helps explain the different dynamic that seems to be playing out within the media revenue line, domestically versus international. And whether you think any of those issues are structural or they just work themselves out with the benefit of time and your execution. And then secondly, if you could talk a bit about how you think about the lifetime value of a non-Prime customer versus a Prime customer and what the intended outcome may be as it relates to the increase in super saver pricing in the US market. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first question, certainly we have been launched devices in the US earlier in terms of content, both, you are really referring to mostly eBook content. And both are growing very fast. The base is different, as you mentioned. We have a higher base in the US just based on when we launched. So you're absolutely right. You do see that difference in the media line between North America and international. And so it is just again, both are growing very nicely right now in terms of digital Kindle books. In this case as you referenced, but it is just a different base. And so we're excited about the opportunity that we have in both segments there. But we are further ahead right now in North America. And then, I am sorry, can you repeat the second part of your question again?

SCOTT DEVITT: How do you think about lifetime value of those that are not Prime subs versus Prime subs given the increase you recently did with super saver shipping in the US from $25 to $35 threshold?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Prime customers, we have seen not only a very strong increase in Prime membership but we have seen a very good retention of Prime members. And so certainly, when you look at that, in terms of lifetime value, we have a customer base that is certainly staying with us longer. They are doing more cross shopping and they are getting the benefits of Prime that we are offering that we continue to add to. And then we still have a very good customer base that is non-Prime. You mentioned that the threshold changed. We did change. We have different thresholds in various geographies around the world for super saver, shipped with our super saver delivery in those geographies.

And in the case of the US, we have had the $25 threshold for over 10 years and we changed it to $35. And during this time frame, we have certainly increased our selection that is eligible for that by millions of items. And certainly as you would know, during this rather lengthy time frame, transportation costs and fuel prices have changed significantly over that time period. So we had to change it. So we just thought that was the right thing to do.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: I want to ask about the North American EGM line. I guess it is the second quarter in a row you have had acceleration. When I asked about you about it last quarter, I think you singled out fashion apparel and consumer staples. But the acceleration really seems to be in line with using comps. Is there something in there that to you indicates that you are getting real critical mass with your customers in those two particular categories? And then just real quickly on the Kiva robots, is there a reason you would call that out? Should that have some sort of material impact over time on leverage in the fulfillment cost line? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of our growth in EGM, you highlighted a couple of categories that are growing very nicely that we mentioned last quarter as well. What you are seeing there, and actually the growth is very broad. We have added a lot of unique selections in both our hard lines and soft lines, categories including consumables and apparel, as you mentioned. The experience has gotten better on the site. Unique selection has increased dramatically over the past few years. So just a number of things are coming together in those categories so when I look at it, it just seems very broad, which we like. And there is just a lot of new selection with great category expansion too over the last several years. That is really what you are seeing there.

In terms of Kiva, we have launched in a few FCs. We think it is an interesting opportunity. I think as I mentioned, last quarter at this time we're ahead of the schedule that we had set forth at the time, that we joined with Kiva and we are excited what we see. Certainly, we will still be adding associates. Certainly over time in those FCs but this certainly will be productivity with Kiva. And we will have to stay tuned to see what that looks like but we are certainly excited about that opportunity and the roll out.

OPERATOR: Victor Anthony, Topeka Capital Markets.

VICTOR ANTHONY, ANALYST, TOPEKA CAPITAL MARKETS: ROIC is the metric you highlighted each quarter. It has hovered around 20%, 30%, 40% range throughout the quarters of 2010, 2011. It is obviously been depressed over the past several year and a half due to investments. Maybe you can help us with the timing of when you expect ROIC to return to levels we saw in 2011. And second, you are investing a lot in video content for Prime Instant Video. Are there any hard numbers you can share in terms of conversions from the Kindle devices? And there -- in the past there has been talk about converting Prime Instant Video into standalone product. Maybe you can share your thoughts there. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Keep in mind, when the -- as you mentioned, we are investing very heavily in the business. We think that is the right thing to do. We have a lot of good long-term opportunities which is why we are doing it. It is depressing ROIC. Just keep in mind from a pure metric standpoint, just as a reminder, the way we measure ROIC is free cash flow divided by average investor capital so total assets minus current liabilities. That is over a five point average and so when you do that first in the numerator, we do have, keep in mind, it's about $1.4 billion in our free cash flow number that relates to the purchase. It goes back to Q4 last year but it's in our TTM free cash flow that relates to the purchase of our campus here in Seattle and some nearby land, so it's $4.4 billion of that. So that is bringing the free cash flow down.

Also keep in mind in the invested capital, we do include cash and marketable securities which is certainly the largest piece of our invested capital. We think that is the right thing to do until we either deploy that capital or return it in some way. Just keep in mind that is included in the metric. In terms of Prime Instant Video, we are getting great usage from a broad set of customers on Kindle as well as other devices, and the adoption is going very well. I apologize. I can't share any specific metrics today but we like what we see. It certainly -- we think it is certainly helping the Prime numbers, you know, the Prime membership increases that you're seeing. It is -- we think it is interesting and we are investing there. We included in both our Q3 results as well as the Q4 guidance, our assumptions around additional content that we'll be acquiring including original content. So I am very excited about that opportunity.

OPERATOR: Mark May, Citi.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITI: The seasonal hiring is -- I think last year it grew about in line with growth rate in US revenue growth. But this year it looks like it's -- you are growing it about 10 percentage points above the midpoint of your range. Is there anything that is different this year that is driving that? And then second question on pricing. There have been numerous reports recently, and I think for a while now, that the multi-channel competitors are competing more fiercely with Amazon in terms of price parity, et cetera. What impact are you seeing or do you think you could see from that and how you are addressing it? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the seasonal employees, unfortunately there is not a lot I can add to that. We are getting ready for an exciting holiday season. And that includes making sure that we have the right amount of employees as well as seasonal help during that period. It also includes making sure that we have the right capacity in place, making sure we have -- we have added a lot of selection over the past couple of years and particularly over the last 12 months in making sure that we have good in-stock levels related to that selection. We are making sure that we have people to help us with not only serving customers with our retail inventory but also Fulfilled by Amazon has grown, certainly very strongly over the past year. And that impacts the capacity and the number of employees that you see there.

So that is really what you are seeing in that number. In terms of pricing, we operate in a very competitive arena. That is not something that is new. That is something that we have been doing since our inception. We have many, many different competitors. You will pass those competitors on your way to work and on your way home. They are offline, they are offline. It's a very competitive marketplace. It is something -- pricing is something that we worked very hard at over the years. We want to make sure that we have great values for our customers. And it is something that we spent a lot of time on and worked very hard to make sure that we can offer that to customers. So I would not say that it is anything new. It is something that we have been dealing with since our inception. But it is a very competitive environment.

OPERATOR: Carlos Kirjner, Sanford Bernstein.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: Two quick questions. First, how do you see your competitive position versus Alibaba in China and what gives you confidence that you have a chance of being a relevant player there, even in the long term? And secondly, in the US you have a service similar to subscription video-on-demand that is a feature of Prime which is Amazon Prime video, while in Europe you have a full-blown standalone service you offer them. Why is your strategy in Europe so different from your strategy in the US when it comes to video-on-demand? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of China, it is very early there. There is certainly room for many winners. It's a very large segment. We have seen -- we have a good business there in terms of top line that is growing, and we continue to look for ways to make sure that we satisfy customer demand. We work on a lot of the same inputs that we work on in our other geographies to make sure that we have great prices, good selection, speed of delivery. We've worked very hard in terms of putting in a lot of capacity close to customers. So those are the things that we're working on to try to ensure our success there.

In terms of the visual competitors, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about other companies, but again, there is room for a lot of winners. In terms of video content, there's not a lot that I can add to that question. I apologize. But certainly we have been ramping up our content in the US on Amazon.com as part of Amazon Prime. It is something that we have been looking at very carefully. We like what we see so far. We think it is interesting but beyond that, I can't speculate what we might do or might not do in another location.

OPERATOR: Mark Miller, William Blair.

MARK MILLER, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY: On AmazonFresh, can you comment on what you are seeing in LA versus the Seattle test? How important is the attachment rate with general merchandise? And then as you are making more frequent deliveries, are you finding that it is driving higher sales of general merchandise?

TOM SZKUTAK: It is very, very early in LA, but we see so far we like. We are adding a lot of selection there on behalf of customers. It is a great opportunity for customers to get both a number of different items through AmazonFresh. So we are excited. We like the trials that we have done have been very good. The conversion has been good. We look forward to even improving the experience even more over time for customers but it is very early. We like what we see but you will have to stay tuned on that one.

MARK MILLER: And with general merchandise?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sorry?

MARK MILLER: Are you selling more general merchandise as a result of more frequent deliveries in that market?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes.

OPERATOR: Kerry Rice, Needham & Company.

KERRY RICE, ANALYST, NEEDHAM & COMPANY: I just wanted to ask a question on your acquisition of TenMarks which is really diving a little bit deeper into the Ed Tech market. I know you sell and rent the textbooks. Can you talk a little bit maybe what your strategy is there?

TOM SZKUTAK: We though it was a company that is doing some interesting things about helping students and children learn math. We thought it was an interesting fit for us, and we look forward to exploring what opportunities we can do together there. And you'll have to stay tuned on that one but we think it is -- it's doing a very nice job and we are very excited to have them as part of the Amazon business.

OPERATOR: Scott Tilghman, B. Riley.

SCOTT TILGHMAN, ANALYST, B. RILEY CARIS: I just wanted to touch on the North American segment margins for a little bit. We have seen some pretty good progress there in terms of year-over-year improvement, a little bit of a back step last quarter but not too much. The category fell back this quarter. I am wondering if there is anything unusual there in terms of timing or investments that may be more called out and how we should think about it over the next few quarters.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of Q3 specifically, Q3 just because of the, as I would call it the Q4 readiness, the seasonal readiness, you see this often in Q3 where both our total and our segment operating profit is lower than other quarters. That certainly is what you are seeing in Q3 in North America, so that is in terms of the investments we are making to get ready for the season. We talked about, you heard in Jeff's quote, the capacity that we are adding and certainly in multiple geographies but certainly in the North America is impacting that as well. You can see it in our fulfillment line item as a percentage of revenue being up. You can see it in our technical content. We are certainly investing. The other part too that I mentioned earlier is we are investing in video content for Prime in the US, and you see that certainly in this result as well.

OPERATOR: Tom Forte, Telsey.

TOM FORTE, ANALYST, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP: I wanted to know where you stand. Last year, I think you added 20 fulfillment centers on a full-year basis. And the last time you gave us an update, I think this year it was five US and a handful of international. I wanted to know where you stood on that and why the change versus last year. And then also very quickly I wanted to see where you stood or how you felt about your Amazon locker initiative. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of fulfillment centers, the number is seven but it is a net number. And so included in that are several consolidations. We are building generally larger FCs and we are consolidating some of those. So that is a net seven. And so what that means is if you were to take that as a percentage of our total fulfillment centers, you would certainly get a number that is less than the square footage that we are actually adding. We are adding square footage that would be significantly higher than that. In terms of lockers, it is early. It is another way to get closer to customers to make it convenient for customers, and it is interesting. We have it in a few different geographies right now. It is limited. We do not have it probably across our full network. So that is something we are learning. It is an interesting experience. It is certainly something that over time we will continue to take a closer look at and certainly expand if it makes sense to do so on behalf of customers.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: I just want to ask two things. First, Tom, can you give us some color on where you are in the shift from third party to first party eBooks and how much of a factor that has been in re-accelerating media revenue? We have seen re-acceleration in media the last three quarters I think in North America. And then secondly, it looks like there are six fewer shopping days this holiday season between Black Friday and Christmas. I am just curious what you do if anything differently to prepare for that and do you think that could actually drive more holiday shopping online. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of your second one, second question, there are fewer days. There is not a lot that we do different. We certainly see when that happens, there is some behavioral differences on behalf of customers just because of the shorter time period. We have certainly some more sizable days during that period. But there is not a lot to add to that. In terms of the transition for eBooks, in terms of our total growth across Amazon on both North America total or global total, it is not a significant or meaningful impact to the overall growth rate. And certainly this transition has been going on for some number of quarters now so there is not a lot I can help you with there.

OPERATOR: Greg Melich, ISI Group.

GREG MELICH, ANALYST, ISI GROUP: I wanted to dig into the inventory a little bit. It looks like the growth slowed to 20% if the sale is accelerated. Tom, could you give us an insight as to why that is and maybe which categories out- performed in the quarter?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, I would look at it more from a turns perspective. And if you look at it more over an average turns basis, it has gone down and the reason is unique selection. We keep adding a growth and unique selection so it certainly has increased over the past year, in stock levels have gotten better. And so those are the things that are really driving it. In terms of endpoints for any particular quarter, they can be a little bit lumpy, but I would look to the turns.

OPERATOR: John Blackledge, Cowan and Company.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Two questions. First, is it a priority to offer one day or same day delivery at some point as some competitors are offering same-day delivery in large markets for certain brick and mortar retailers? And then secondly, can you talk about the prospects for the log in and pay program? How many online merchants are signed up for it and what is Amazon getting out of it either economically and/or from getting data out of the purchases? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of speed of delivery, whether it be one day or same day, what has happened certainly over the past 10 plus years is we have added a lot of selection, we have added a lot of fulfillment centers. As a result of that, we have selection that is by default, increased in our selection that's closer and closer to customers. As a result of that, our speed of delivery has improved. And certainly for Prime customers, depending upon the geography in the case of the US, we have expressed two day shipping for free and then first of all fees so they get it faster than that. That is something that you have seen that improvement gradually over the past 10 plus years. You have seen it certainly getting even better the last few years as we have rapidly increased the number of fulfillment centers.

That is something that we think is important and we will continue to work on behalf of customers to give them those options and to make sure they get product when they want it. In terms of log in and pay, it is something that we think is interesting. Because of our large customer base and the credentials that we have and the secure payments that we have, we think it is an interesting opportunity. We think that there is -- it is certainly interesting ways to monetize that over time. But again, we think it is an interesting opportunity.

OPERATOR: Ron Josey, JMP Securities.

RON JOSEY, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: I want to talk about newer international markets. Specifically, I think Amazon India was called out given 10 new category launches in the past 120 days or so. My question is related to infrastructure in India and how good is it so that Amazon can continue to grow there. Specifically if other countries can follow a model like this, Brazil comes to mind. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. We have a few different models in India. And we -- from a -- we have a marketplace model which we offer Fulfilled by Amazon, which as you mentioned, certainly would be infrastructure is not as advanced as some geographies but we also we also view that as an opportunity. And we're happy to help sellers, we'll fulfill by Amazon. It is an interesting opportunity. It is very, very early. We are in investment mode there. It's a long-term opportunity but it is a very exciting opportunity. We are a very strong team that is working on that opportunity. So we're excited about it.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Jefferies.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Maybe you could comment on what you are seeing domestically and internationally in terms of eCommerce trends in the current quarter. Anything specific stand out, especially in North America, given some of the mixed commentary we have heard from some of your competitors? And then just some additional comments if you could on growth in the other revenue category, specifically on AWS and/or on your advertising business. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. I will take the second one first. In terms of AWS, it is growing very, very strong. It is an area that is very early for us. It is growing very, very strong. We have a great team that is working on it, servicing customers, and we are very excited about the long-term opportunity. In terms of you mentioned the trends in North America, what you have see is there are really a nice steady acceleration of growth since Q4 last year. If you look back to Q4 last year, for North America specifically, and you just trace that back over the past four quarters, you see a really nice sequential increase from quarter to quarter. Again, that gets back to it went from 23% in Q4 last year to 26% to 30% and 31%. Those are the year-over-year increases in by quarter for North America revenue And so a lot of it is what we talked about earlier. It is focused on a lot of the retail basics as well as also improving seller performance as well. Those are things that are driving it.

OPERATOR: Jordan Rohan, Stifel Nicolaus.

JORDAN ROHAN, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: A follow-up to the last question on US in particular. Did you see any weakness or any discernible trends around the government shutdown and all of the politics going on in Washington in September and early October? And separately, can you talk about what you are learning from being an investor in LivingSocial? The accounting charges aside, can you talk about your own local business, how that may compete with other players in the space and all of the various initiatives you have with? What can be learned from what you know at this point? You are no longer a new investor in that company. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of North America growth, other than what I mentioned on the quarterly growth, Q3 was strong, 31% growth. Again, we see a nice steady increase over the past four quarters. That is overlapping a quarter from Q3 of last year that was 33%. So again, we like what we see from a growth perspective in Q3 for North America. In terms of total growth, giving a wide range for Q4 and that reflects our view for Q4 but we are excited about the quarter and about getting ready for customers during this heavy seasonal quarter. So we are excited about what we see there. In terms of LivingSocial, there is really not a lot that I can add to your question. I apologize. They are doing a good job in terms of local. We also have a local offering on Amazon. The team is very dedicated to make that work and it is an interesting area. We're learning but it is early.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: When you look at the deceleration in growth in North America and other revenue and obviously it is still at a very high level. When we are thinking about the major components of that line, AWS, advertising, credit card relationship, is there anything relevant to the relative growth rates between those components that we should be thinking about?

TOM SZKUTAK: I am not sure how to answer your question. The only part I would call out, you mentioned there is a number of different items that is in there. Certainly the largest and fastest growing largest area by far is AWS, and it is growing very nicely. That is certainly reflected in that line item.

SEAN BOYLE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Thank you. That does conclude our conference. You may now disconnect. ( End of transcript )

Presentation

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2013 financial results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.

   TD
For opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead, sir.

SEAN BOYLE, VP IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO, who will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 25, 2013, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our second-quarter financial results.

Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 41% to $4.53 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 76% to $265 million.

Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.27 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter 2012. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consistent of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

Return on invested capital was 2%, down from 11%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current facilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 474 million shares compared with 468 million shares.

Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $15.7 billion or 25% excluding the $392 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.

Media revenue increased to $4.4 billion, up 7% or 11% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.42 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 66% of worldwide sales, up from 64%.

Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts exceeded $215 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.

Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.2 billion, or 71.4% of revenue, compared with 73.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $4.09 billion or 26% of sales, up approximately 275 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $1.76 billion or 11.2% of revenue compared with 10.1%. Tech and content was $1.43 billion or 9.1% of revenue compared with 7.6%. Marketing was $651 million or 4.1% of revenue, consistent with the prior period.

Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 30% to $9.49 billion. Media revenue grew 16% to $2.17 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $6.48 billion, representing 68% of North America revenues, up from 67%. North America segment operating income increased 19% to $409 million, a 4.3% operating margin.

In the International segment, revenue grew 13% to $6.21 billion. Adjusting for the $391 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign-exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%.

Media revenue decreased 1% to $2.22 billion or grew 7% excluding foreign exchange. In EGM, revenue grew 22% to $3.94 billion, or 29% excluding foreign-exchange. EGM now represents 63% of International revenues, up from 59%.

International segment operating income was zero, down from $16 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income increased 11%.

CSOI increased 14% to $409 million or 2.6% of revenue, down approximately 20 basis points year over year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 19%.

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 26% to $79 million, or 0.5% of net sales.

Our income tax expense was $13 million. GAAP net loss was $7 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared with net income of $7 million and $0.01 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.49 billion year over year to $7.46 billion. Inventory increased 24% to $5.42 billion and inventory turns were 9.4, down from 10.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.

Accounts payable increased 27% to $8.99 billion and accounts payable days increased to 73 from 68 in the prior year.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we've described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements; record any further revisions of stock-based compensation estimates; and that foreign-exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q3 2013, we expect net sales of between $15.45 billion and $17.15 billion, a growth between 12% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating loss to be between $440 million and $65 million compared to $28 million in third quarter 2012. This includes approximately $340 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between a $100 million loss and $275 million in income compared to $232 million of income in third quarter 2012.

We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks, and with that, Sean, let's move to questions.

SEAN BOYLE: Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator instructions) Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks guys, I just had one question on shipping. It looks like the unit efficiency in shipping continues to improve. What are you guys doing to drive the cost of shipping each unit lower? Are there more costs that can be taken out on a per-unit basis?

And then, as you start looking at same-day delivery in some of these markets, including the new grocery program, what incremental costs do you see around doing same-day fulfillment? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the economics, we have a great operations team that's working on how do we serve customers reliably and faster. So, certainly, that is reflected in our transportation costs. Also, from a productivity standpoint, we're just -- as we add capacity, we're just getting closer and closer to customers with larger selection, which is certainly helpful from a productivity standpoint.

So those are some of the dynamics that you need to think about when you think about our transportation cost. The team has done a great job over the years of becoming even more reliable and faster and more productive. And, again, they will be working on ways to make that even better over time.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Great, thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more just on the profitability of the grocery business and how you will know when it's the right time to expand to more markets beyond Seattle and L.A.

And then also, if you could comment on the European macro environment, just given the growth that you saw in the International business just decelerating a little bit from last quarter. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the fresh business, we started doing a pilot several years ago in Seattle. We did a number of -- the team has done a great job inventing on behalf of customers. It's a very good customer experience. The challenge that we've had over the past several years is how to make it economically viable. And so that's -- the team has done a lot of different experiments and invented well on behalf of customers to see what works. And we took a lot of that knowledge, which enabled us to launch fresh in L.A. And it's very early there; we're still in the trial period. It's a good customer experience and we like what we see so far, but it's very, very early.

So it's something that we will continue to work on, both from a customer experience and from an economic standpoint. There's not much more I can add to that right now, so you'll have to stay tuned and see where that ends up.

OPERATOR: Mark Miller, William Blair.

MARK MILLER, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY: Hi good afternoon. Could you help us understand the third-party unit growth? I think this is the first quarter in about three years that third-party unit penetration hasn't increased.

And then, additionally, I'm wondering if you could comment at all on potential to expand Prime membership options potentially to something like a super-Prime offering for expanded video content and fulfillment options.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the third-party unit growth, it was 40% this quarter, which compares to the 40% last year in Q2. So, again, it is flat as a percentage of total units.

One thing to keep in mind, though, is our digital units are growing at a faster rate than physical, and those digital units are primarily first-party units. So if you take out -- digital units out in both periods, we are actually up approximately 300 basis points. So our physical seller business is growing very nicely. It's growing at a faster rate than retail and it's doing very well. And so very pleased to see that.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Jefferies.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Great, thanks. Quick question on fulfillment centers -- any color on your current plan for the year in terms of locations, US versus International, timing, etc.? And then, separately, any comments on the weaker growth in International media?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of FCs, we have announced to date five net new facilities in the US. We've also announced some in International. It's still early, as we did in prior -- last few years. We gave you updates as we went along, and so we can update you a little bit later in the year to see how that progresses, but we certainly are adding new capacity and that's reflected in the guidance that you see in Q3 as we get ready for our Q4 seasonal quarter.

In terms of growth in International media, what you are seeing there is, on a local currency growth basis, you see a 7% growth that's consistent with what you've seen in the last couple of quarters. We are at the very early stages. We are excited about what we are seeing so far in digital, but we are in that early stage of transformation from physical to digital within International. And so you see from the release that we have launched a lot of new things related to digital over the past 90 days and even prior to that. So we are very excited about those launches and excited about the transformation.

We are also excited, if you look at our total International business, we've got a lot of opportunities to invest in. I talked about the conversion from physical to digital. We also have selection still to add within existing categories, new categories, new geographies. So we are very excited about the opportunity that we have there.

BRIAN PITZ: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi, thanks. I guess the International topic again, but it has been asked a few times. So maybe specifically in China, Tom, in terms of what the Company hypothesis is in terms of the way that market plays out over time and how you think about investment spend in that market.

And then secondly, as it relates to AWS, it's nice, the event, the annual event and the quarterly events that happened. I was wondering when you think it makes sense to start talking more about it in releases and on calls. Is it just the 10% revenue threshold or something else that would lead to more discussions like that on calls like this? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of China, we are investing heavily in China, and we have been for some number of years. We have a good customer experience there. We continue to look at ways to make that even better. We are adding selection across many categories right now. It's a very interesting geography.

And so we will continue to work on that experience for customers. You should expect to see us to be in investment mode for some time, but it's a very sizable segment, very interesting long-term growth opportunity, and we will continue to work on making that better for customers and for investors over time.

In terms of AWS, the business is growing very, very strongly. We've got a great team that's innovating on behalf of customers, launching new services, becoming more productive, which allows us to be able to lower prices. We've had many price reductions since we started with AWS, and we share that very visibly. And so we are very excited about that business. Even though we are off to a very good start, it's a very big opportunity and we continue to invest in that business and we are very excited to do it. We think it's a great long-term opportunity and we have a great team working on it.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, RBC.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Great, thanks. Tom, just one question related to consumer packaged goods. Any comments there on whether you are seeing broader purchases by the Amazon customers of more traditional consumer staples than you've seen in the past, and is that something you are trying to promote? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, just to make sure I have your question, we are seeing -- when you look at our, for example, our North America growth, particularly EGM, we are seeing very good growth across many different categories. But a few callouts -- we are seeing very good growth in apparel, specifically, and also consumables.

And so the team has done a very nice job. Both teams have done a very nice job from a customer experience standpoint and been growing very nicely, and that is something that we are seeing and it does help with frequency to the site as well.

OPERATOR: Mark May, Citi.

MARK MAY, ANALYST, CITI: Thanks for taking my question -- another one on International in the media segment there. I believe that you now have a more comprehensive localized international strategy for the Kindle. I wonder if you could talk about what, if any, impact that you think that that might have over the next few quarters in terms of its impact on the International media segment.

And also on international, the AWS, I think one of the contributors of growth and, we suspect, margins in the US has been the success at AWS here. I wonder if you could talk about any plans for AWS outside the US.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of Kindle, you are right. We now have Kindle stores, if you will, established in all of the Amazon domains that we have around the world. And recently we announced Kindle Fire HD; it's available to customers in over 170 countries. We introduced Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Fire HD in China. That's both online on our website, and also in a number of off-line retail locations.

So, again, there's a lot of advancement in terms of the Kindle. But again, it's very early. I'm very encouraged by the opportunity that we have there for customers and our ability to try to capitalize on that from a digital content standpoint.

In terms of AWS, the business is expanding and it's an incredible opportunity globally. We recognize that. The team recognizes that, and we will continue to work on that on behalf of customers.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you. The Company and the business is going through a lot of transitions with digital media, AWS, obviously Prime and potentially same-day delivery. A long time ago, you used to give us a margin outlook for the Company. As you think about these businesses, do you think that they are better for Amazon in that you can have greater share of retail as these evolutions happen?

Also, what are the implications on Amazon's long-term margins as you go through these transitions over time? Any help on that could help. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the way we are looking at them certainly is based on the free cash flow potential. And we have -- we are in some really interesting great businesses that have a lot of potential from a free cash flow generation standpoint, with good, high ROICs, which is exciting.

From a margin standpoint, always challenging to predict where that will come out in terms of absolute numbers, but what we will do is we want to make sure that we try to maximize free cash flow. That's something that we've always said.

So our strategy hasn't changed; our outlook hasn't changed in that regard. Frequently, we would be asked historically, is double-digit operating margins possible? And I still think it's possible. But, also, if it means -- if a good, high-single-digit operating margin gets us to better, higher free cash flow over time, that's fine, too.

So again, our goal is to -- we don't focus on individual margins. Our goal is to make sure that we generate free cash flow, large amounts of free cash flow, and use that capital efficiently. And so those are goals that we have. And we certainly think that opportunity is there in each of the businesses that we operate in.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Macquarie.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Two quick questions on revenue recognition. Over the past some quarters, I believe that the -- certain digital media, at least, has moved around between the agency and wholesale model. Can you help us quantify how this has actually impacted the reported media revenue rates? In other words, would 2Q revenue rates have been meaningfully different if the model had been the same?

And then second question, just quickly -- on Prime, can you remind us how you recognize revenue from the Prime membership fee over the course of the year? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of Prime, we recognize it over the life of the subscription. And then in terms of third-party versus first-party, certainly we have had some shift within digital media. But again, digital media is primarily a first-party business and happens to be one portion of our business.

But you are absolutely right. In terms of our third-party business, which from a unit perspective is 40% of our total units this quarter, we recognize the share of that revenue; the rev share, if you will, as revenue, whereas the other parts of our business, largely, we are recognizing that first-party revenue, and so we are recognizing the full amount of revenue in the current period.

OPERATOR: Jordan Rohan, Stifel Nicolaus.

JORDAN ROHAN, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Thank you so much Sean, I'm curious about your expansion efforts in Spain, since it's a relatively new territory for you, how well situated you are and how ready you are for the fourth quarter there.

And, also, there have been a lot of stories about Amazon heading into Brazil, but I don't believe we have identified any fulfillment centers and things like that. Can you discuss the extent and breadth of your offering in Brazil; whether it's Kindle devices, digital media or something beyond that? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Spain, we are very excited about what we see. It is growing very fast. We are in investment mode and it's an exciting geography for us. We are very optimistic over time it will be a great geography for us. So we are very happy to serve customers in Spain and we continue to, as we have done in other geographies, that we will continue to serve customers and continue to expand selection and get service levels even better over time. So we are very excited about that.

In terms of Brazil, we do have a Kindle Store and we have devices at physical retailers. So from a Kindle perspective, that's what we are doing in Brazil.

OPERATOR: Ron Josey, JMP Securities.

RON JOSEY, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES: Great, thank you for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about North America EGM. Just given the strength you saw in the business and continued re-acceleration, have you seen any sort of impact? I'm assuming no, but from price matching programs, from off-line retailers, and also on sales tax. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of North America total growth, we saw an acceleration from last quarter from 26% to 30%. We saw an acceleration in both North America media as well as North America EGM.

Within EGM, it was very broad in terms of growth. We saw very strong growth across many different categories, and so I'm very pleased with that. I called out a couple that were notable in terms of apparel, as well as in consumables. Certainly, those are getting larger and still growing very fast, which is why I called those out.

In terms of competitiveness, it has been very competitive. It is today; it has been since our inception. We have many different competitors online. We have many competitors off-line. As you go to your home or office, you pass our competitors every day. That's an environment where we are used to dealing in. It's something that's not new. It's something that we see in all of our geographies across many different categories.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great, thanks Tom. As you get closer to customers with more FCs and more efficient shipping, what kind of impact is that having on conversion rates within customers in those areas as shipping times shorten or delivery times shorten?

And then as you look at the early adopters for fresh in L.A., any sense that you can share with us of what kind of cross-shopping you are seeing among new fresh customers? Are they bundling media and EGM in those other orders, or to any degree are these new-to-Amazon customers that have been brought in purely because of fresh?

TOM SZKUTAK: If you take a look at L.A., it's just, again, very excited and it's very early. So I think on that one, you will just have to stay tuned.

But in terms of as we get closer and closer to customers with fulfillment, we have seen growth due to that. And it has manifested its way in a few different ways, but most notably you see it in Prime. We have -- because of our fulfillment logistics capability, we have been able to offer Prime broadly, and we just have selection that's just closer and closer to customers. And if you look back over the last several years, there has been different reasons why we have grown the way we've grown in terms of adding new selection and making sure that we have really sharp pricing.

But certainly, Prime, which includes speeded delivery, has certainly been a notable -- has had a notable impact. And we are very pleased with the Prime program. Customers like it. We see very strong growth in Prime subscribers. We see very good retention of Prime members. So it's a great program for us and certainly, again, delivery speed is certainly impacting that program, our overall growth.

OPERATOR: Anthony DiClemente, Barclays.

ANTHONY DICLEMENTE, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thank you. On the topic of media, just wondering, Tom, if there are any call-outs in terms of categories of strength or weakness within physical or digital media that you could call out. And along those lines, just wondering if you could comment on your media device rollout strategy from here, if there is anything you could tell us.

And then, quickly, is there any reason Prime Instant Video isn't available for Android devices? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of media growth, not a lot of call-outs, except probably the obvious is digital units growing very fast relative to physical units, and we are excited to see that. And because of where we are, we are further penetrated in North America. You are seeing a bigger impact on our growth rate than you are in International, and we certainly see that. But not a lot of other call-outs there.

But, again, we are very pleased, and certainly customers are responding to many things, including selection and great prices and everything else within those digital offerings. But, also, they are responding to unique selection that we have. And if you take a look at our release, you will see the specific numbers related to some of the exclusives we have and, certainly, that is having an impact. So there's many, many different things that are working for us in that space as part of our overall ecosystem for digital that we are pleased with.

In terms of our device plan, we are very pleased with the devices we have to offer customers. We think we have a great offering, both in terms of Kindle and Kindle Fire. In terms of our future roadmap, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what that will be prior to announcement.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Cantor Fitzgerald.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Thank you very much. Two quick questions, please. Tech and content was up to 9% of revenues. I think that's the highest it has ever been. How much of that is actually streaming content-related? How do we look at it going forward? Does it stay at that elevated level?

And then on fresh, is that business profitable for you in the Seattle area? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of tech and content, we are spending in a number of different areas, but there's a few that I would like to highlight. One is certainly -- keep in mind that the infrastructure related to our very fast-growing Web services business is included in tech and content. So, certainly, as we ramp up that business and it is becoming more sizable and growing very fast, you are seeing that impacting that line item.

We are also investing very heavily in digital, and that is across many different parts of our digital offerings there. That's also included. Any of the tech teams that are working on customer experience across Amazon as we grow, so as we support both our seller businesses and our retail businesses, they are included in that line item. So certainly, that's what you are seeing there.

In terms of fresh, we are not breaking out the financials. But keep in mind that fresh was designed as a pilot and, certainly, the economics have improved over time through invention on behalf of the team there as well as operating efficiencies. So again, that was set up as a test, which has enabled us to launch L.A.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, Robert Baird.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: Thanks very much. A quick follow-up on the device strategy. Given the fairly quick pace of innovation in the tablet market overall, I wonder if you can contrast the benefits of that for Amazon, given the popularity of shopping and media apps with the costs and complexity of maintaining your own line of hardware.

And related to this, it seems as if the pace of new content acquisition and licensing has picked up a bit. So I wonder if that reflects any changes in either the competitive dynamics or pricing or some sort of other strategy shift on your part. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of some of the dynamics, we are very excited about our digital business. We are inventing -- you see a lot of different inventions, both on the hardware side as well as on the software side from a device standpoint. You are also seeing a lot of invention around the content side. And we think, for example, Prime instant video, which combines video and our Prime membership, is very compelling, and we are investing heavily in content. It's still very early there, but we are finding that customers, certainly existing Prime members, are more and more streaming content. We are having new Prime members come to Amazon largely because of video in terms of one segment of that population that's coming from new Prime members; it's because of Prime instant video, and we can see that based on the free trials and the conversion of those free trials related to Prime instant video. So that's certainly one portion of our growth in Prime memberships which we find exciting.

For us, we will offer exclusive content on the book side; it's very interesting. So again, we are inventing -- across a lot of different areas. And, yes, there are a lot of different dynamics, but we think we are well suited for both device software and content side of those businesses.

OPERATOR: Matt Nemer, Wells Fargo Securities.

MATT NEMER, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC: Afternoon, just two questions -- one, given your comments that International will be in investment mode for some time, can you just remind us what the priorities are there from either a geography or product standpoint?

And then, secondly, following the management changes at Quidsi, we would love an update on the plans for that business and maybe just a sense for how integrated it is to Amazon retail. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the International piece, what I was referring to was as in investment mode for some time. I was referring to China specifically. We have a lot of opportunity to grow. We'll still continue to invest in International, but my comment was specifically around China.

And then your question around Quidsi?

OPERATOR: Stephen Ju, Credit Suisse.

STEPHEN JU, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Tom --

TOM SZKUTAK: Hello? Just to follow up, the Quidsi question, I think, was around the founders leaving. We will position with them leaving. I missed the last part of that, but we are fortunate to have the founders with us for a number of years. They did a great job while they were here and we have a great team at Quidsi. We are pleased with that business and the retail team works very closely with the Quidsi business and we are excited to have that as part of Amazon team.

STEPHEN JU: Tom, is there anything you can share in terms of the situation in Germany with the workers' strike? Are you able to fulfill from unaffected fulfillment centers, or is it causing some hindrance to your operations there?

Also if you can update us on what you have been doing with Kiva since you have acquired it. Are you focusing more on internal integration, or are you selling more aggressively to external clients? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Germany, there's not a lot I can add to there. We are certainly serving customers. Those results are reflected in our overall total results that you see today for Q2 as well as our International results.

In terms of Kiva, we certainly -- we have a great team there, love the technology. We don't have any announcements in terms of rollouts, but we are ahead of schedule from what we had set out at the time of purchase, which we are happy about. So we'll have to stay tuned on the actual rollout, but we are very encouraged by what we see there.

OPERATOR: Ken Sena, Evercore Partners.

KEN SENA, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS: Hi, thank you. Just going back to your comments on unit acceleration, has the shift from agency to wholesale in terms of the DOJ e-book settlement -- has that completed, or are you still working your way through many of the US publishers? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: We are working through it. I wouldn't say that that's complete, but we are working through it.

SEAN BOYLE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone; thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Amazon.com first-quarter 2013 financial results teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and after the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. And for opening marks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Mr. Boyle, please go ahead.

   TD
SEAN BOYLE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to or Q1 2013 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2013 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP & CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our first-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 39% to $4.25 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 85% to $177 million. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.07 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in fourth quarter 2012.

The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacities to support our fulfillment operations.

Return on invested capital was 1%, down from 12%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.

The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 471 million shares compared with 464 million one year ago.

Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $16.07 billion or 24% excluding the $302 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.

Media revenue increased to $5.06 billion, up 7% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.21 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales up from 60%.

Worldwide paid unit growth was 30%. Active customer accounts exceeded 209 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.

Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.8 billion or 73.4% of revenue compared with 76.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.83 billion or 23.8% of sales, up approximately 289 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.74 billion or 10.8% of revenue compared with 9.5%. Tech and content was $1.26 billion or 7.9% of revenue compared with 6.5%. Marketing was $616 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.6%.

Now I will talk about our segment results and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment revenue grew 26% to $9.39 billion. Media revenue grew 14% to $2.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 28% to $6.13 billion representing 65% of North America revenues up from 64%.

North America segment operating income increased 31% to $457 million, a 4.9% operating margin. In the international segment revenue grew 16% to $6.68 billion. Adjusting for the $301 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact revenue growth was 21%.

Media revenue grew 1% to $2.54 billion or 7% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 28% to $4.09 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 61% of international revenues up from 56%.

International segment operating loss was $16 million, a 0.2% negative operating margin compared with income of $49 million. CSOI increased 11% to $441 million or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 27 basis points year-over-year.

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 6% to $181 million or 1.1% of net sales.

Our income tax benefit was $18 million and includes $46 million of discrete tax benefits primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit that was enacted in January 2013. GAAP net income was $82 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $130 million and $0.28 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.18 billion year-over-year to $7.89 billion. Inventory increased 27% to $5.4 billion and inventory turns were 9.5, down from 10.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts Payable increased 29% to $8.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 68 from 62 in the prior year.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as -- settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries; unfavorable resolution of legal matters; and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q2 2013 we expect net sales of between $14.5 billion and $16.2 billion or growth of between 13% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 275 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $340 million loss and $10 million income compared to $107 million income in the prior year period. This includes approximately $340 million for stock-based compensation amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between zero and $350 million compared to $360 million in the prior year period. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. With that, Sean, let's move to questions.

SEAN BOYLE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Brian Pitz, Jefferies.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Great, thanks. In February you changed your FBA fulfillment fees. Any comments on how this affected third party sales and what was the overall merchant response? And then just quickly, any update on your latest plans for new fulfillment centers in 2013? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: I will take the second part of the question first. In terms of new fulfillment centers, we have announced three in the US right now and then a few outside of the US consistent with prior years. It is early; we really like the growth that we are experiencing. We will be adding more FCs through the course of the year. But stay tuned and we'll update you as we go.

In terms of FBA, there's not a lot I can talk to there. We are very pleased with the FBA business. We think it is great for sellers, great for customers and we are pleased to offer that service.

BRIAN PITZ: Great, thanks.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks. Tom, the international segment sales growth of 21% (excluding foreign exchange rates) continues to show modest deceleration and I think with the exception of 4Q it has been trailing US growth. And I understand that AWS is mostly booked in the US so that is a piece of the delta. But you have talked in the past quarters about the investments in international driving margin to these breakeven levels in international. I was wondering if you could just talk through the deceleration in the revenue growth in those markets and whether that is comp related, Europe macro or otherwise?

And then secondly, shipping cost on a net basis is again leveraging, I think that is the second consecutive quarter. I just wonder if you could refresh us in terms of when the accounting change occurred in terms of the shipping revenue calculation for FBA to just understand if that is an organic number now. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: The second half of the question there's -- it is organic so there is no -- it is consistent year-over-year. So this is the first quarter that it will be consistent year-over-year.

In terms of your question on international, we are seeing still very solid growth, 21% on a local currency basis. As you have read, certainly there is some softness from a macro standpoint that others are seeing. Hard to know whether that is impacting us and how much; we are not a bellwether for the economy. But we are very pleased with the growth that we are seeing; again 21% on a local currency basis, unit growth is actually growing substantially faster than that. So again, that is what we are seeing.

In terms of investing, you're absolutely right; we are investing in a number of geographies including certainly China we have been investing for several years, we continue to invest in there. We think it is a great long-term opportunity, but we are in investment mode. And certainly some of the more recent additions that we have had with Italy and Spain, that's certainly in investment mode as well.

SCOTT DEVITT: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks. Just a broad question on demand, this kind of midteens at the low-end revenue growth that you have been kind of guiding to for a quarter or two now, that would seem well below the average that you've seen in the past. Are there any other factors you would want to call out or specifically not call out?

Do you think that things like the imposition of state sales taxes are having a near-term drag on growth rates? Last quarter I think you talked about consumer electronics at the high-end. Are there any particular categories there you would want to call out as maybe driving that low that could produce the low-end of the range outside of negative FX? Thanks, Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. As we've been consistently doing, we're giving a wide range. We think that's appropriate given all the factors. That is not something new that we are doing, that is something that we have been doing for some time. And you are right; the growth rate guidance for Q2 is 13% to 26%. Certainly foreign exchange is having an impact, that includes approximately 275 basis points of foreign exchange. So it is approximately 16% to 29% on a local currency basis.

So again, it's a wide range. And there's probably not a lot to add there, but it takes into account all of the things that we think we need to take into account as we give guidance. And in terms of the absolute dollar range, it is very similar to what we would have -- in terms of the dollar range; we would have given for Q1. I think it is maybe a $100 million difference in terms of the absolute value of that range that we gave. So again, a wide range; we think that that is appropriate.

MARK MAHANEY: Thank you, Tom.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Macquarie.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Are there any factors that are impacting the unit growth, particularly the shift from physical to digital? For instance a rented video versus purchasing a video? Or are there any other factors that you would highlight that are impacting the unit growth?

TOM SZKUTAK: The one factor I would call out -- first of all in terms of overall unit growth, our overall unit growth is 30% year over year, again very solid growth. It compares to approximately 49% in Q1 of last year. So we are certainly overlapping a pretty strong growth last Q1.

In terms of the physical and digital, certainly one thing that we are seeing is certainly digital is growing at a much faster rate. And where you do see that a little bit is in our third-party units as a percentage of total units. You will see that that's approximately 40% this quarter. That compares to last year up about approximately 100 basis points.

But what we are seeing is because the digital units are growing at a faster rate and they are mostly first party, you are seeing that number impacted where that percentage as a percentage of our total is not growing as fast as it has the last few quarters. And again, that is largely driven by the digital units growth that you are seeing.

So again, that's -- if you were to back out, for example, and just look at our physical units, our third party physical units as a percentage of total physical units this year versus last year is up over 300 basis points. Again, that is 3P growth as a percentage of total physical units.

BEN SCHACHTER: Thanks.

OPERATOR: Ross Sandler, Deutsche Bank.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks, guys. A question on the -- a follow-up question on the shipping. So just your shipping cost, not your net shipping margin, but just shipping cost relative to gross profit declined about 300 basis points, similar to what you have seen over the past four quarters. So as you start to comp some of these efficiency gains that you are seeing in shipping, do you think that line will continue to show leverage or is it going to start to level out from here? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: We are not giving -- certainly not giving guidance on any specific line item, but certainly over a long period of time we think there is opportunity to be more productive there and there are certainly efficiency gains to be had there. And that's something that certainly the team will continuously work on.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, Robert W. Baird & Co.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO.: A question on Web services. I wonder if you can comment on enterprise-level adoption and whether there are any meaningful barriers to that happening over time. We noticed you have been pretty aggressive in hiring enterprise-level salespeople. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: No, I don't think that there is. I think that the team is doing a fantastic job in terms of developing services that are great for many different customer types including enterprises. And the team is heads down focused on making sure we have a great operational -- these services are great from an operational standpoint and security standpoint and they are doing a terrific job.

And so, it is a very great opportunity for enterprises to adopt our Web services and the team is certainly focused on that along with the other customers, and so -- other customer sets. So again, it is a great opportunity for those customers and for us.

COLIN SEBASTIAN: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking the question. You have clearly been more aggressive in terms of video content recently and you are sort of leading with it more in the release tonight in terms of the business content. I was hoping you could just add some more color here on the value that you think that TV and movie content adds to consumers' overall purchase patterns? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. It is certainly one of our digital offerings and we have a number of different -- a few different services. We have certainly content that we are using as part of our Prime offer that we have a lot of free content for customers. We think that is a great service to customers along with our express shipping offers, as well as other content that we have free, for example our Kindle owners lending library for books.

So again, we think it is a great -- Prime is a great value for customers and it's part of that value proposition. We also have a very good transaction business for video as well that's growing very, very fast and certainly customers like it and we are seeing that reflected in the results that you see today.

DOUG ANMUTH: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: I was wondering if you could help us a little bit about the Kindle ecosystem. On prior calls a few years ago you singled it out as a fast growth area and you were very happy with the performance. We haven't heard as much about it lately. Kind of the impact part of how units are doing against your expectations and then the impact it is having on Prime subs and also your gross and operating margins? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: We are very pleased with our Kindle and digital business and we are super excited. In terms of the ecosystem, you are certainly seeing that in our results that you see today. For example, if you look at our media growth we are certainly -- that ecosystem is more penetrated there than it is in international and you see that reflected in those associated growth rates.

Another way you see it is if you take a look at our top 10 best-selling items worldwide in Q1, the top 10 are all either digital or Kindle related, Paperwhite is our best-selling product worldwide. But again, all 10 spots in the Q1 were either Kindle or digital items and I believe that that is the first time that we have seen that.

We have been looking at that from a quarterly results standpoint for some period of time and we have had various levels of the top 10, but I think this may be the first quarter that we have had all top 10 being either or Kindle related or digital related. So again, we are very pleased with what we are doing there and we are going to continue to innovate on behalf of customers.

JUSTIN POST: And any impact on your gross or operating margins that you want to call out?

TOM SZKUTAK: The one thing I would say is we certainly are investing. It is certainly an area of investment and you are seeing that reflected. We are making a number of investments across the business and certainly we are investing in Kindle and our digital offerings, we are investing in some of the other things I mentioned earlier like China, some of the emerging geographies. So those are certainly some of the larger key investments we are making.

JUSTIN POST: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Matt Nemer, Wells Fargo Securities.

MATT NEMER, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES: Good afternoon. We are hearing reports that there is refrigeration equipment going into some of your fulfillment centers outside of the Seattle area. Just wondering if you can update us on plans to expand AmazonFresh? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: No, have nothing to announce. We are very pleased with what we have seen in the Seattle area, but again it has been a test and we continue to monitor that test carefully. It is certainly something that we see that customers love the experience. The challenge has always been making sure we can get the economics right and that is something we will continue to focus on.

OPERATOR: Stephen Ju, Credit Suisse.

STEPHEN JU, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Anything you can say in terms of how much Amazon is in video as well as potentially your own in-house produced content currently helps and should in the future help reduce churn in Amazon Prime? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks for the question. Yes, it is something -- we haven't released any of the numbers, it is something that we are tracking very closely. It is something that we believe over time will reduce churn and is certainly helping today.

What we are seeing is great traction. We see a lot of usage of the service. Customers love it and we think it is a very interesting part of Prime offering and that is why we have been expanding and why you see some of the more recent announcements including some of the stuff included in the earnings release today around original content. So again, it is something that we find very interesting and we are excited about it.

OPERATOR: Ken Sena, Evercore Partners.

KEN SENA, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS: I was just hoping you could maybe provide a little bit more color on the unit growth deceleration. And looking back over the last four quarters it seems like about 500 basis points or so each quarter of deceleration. You had about 200 basis points here which is an improvement, but anything you would say just to any signs of maturity in some of the businesses and maybe where that deceleration is specifically coming from? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: No, there is not a lot I can add. I think the -- 30% is still a very strong growth rate. Again, it is growing at a faster rate than revenue, revenue at 22%, revenue at a local currency growth of 24% very strong; third-party growth continues to be very strong. Retail growth is strong.

So again, there's not a lot I can provide you there. But again, keep in mind that we are overlapping 49% growth last year Q1 which is certainly a little bit of a difficult compare. But again, pleased with the 30% growth rate.

OPERATOR: John Blackledge, Cowen and Company.

JOHN BLACKLEDGE, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Great, thanks. Just a question on the Amazon advertising platform. Given the immense amount of purchase data you have on Amazon customers, how is that being used as a competitive advantage and maybe just provide an overall view on the direction of the Amazon ad platform over time?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the platform itself, we think it is a very sizable, very good long-term opportunity for us and it is something that we've been working on for some time and we just think it is very interesting. One thing you will notice on our site, we're being obviously very -- making sure the customer experience is great.

What we're really trying to do is we are trying to help customers find and discover what they want to buy online. So we are very -- again, it is very customer centric, but it is also from a business standpoint a very good long-term opportunity. We have a great team that is working on the opportunity and we are excited about the long-term potential of it.

OPERATOR: Anthony DiClemente, Barclays.

ANTHONY DICLEMENTE, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thanks. I am just wondering what you are seeing in terms of the attach rate of your transactional video on demand business versus usage of Prime instant video. I am wondering just if your consumers tend to choose between the two when they are making a selection. Or does one sort of drive the other? Does a Prime subscriber have a higher transactional VOD attach rate than a non-Prime? So it would be helpful to hear what you are seeing there in terms of usage.

TOM SZKUTAK: I think the only thing I can help you with is we see -- I will take Prime customers for example. We certainly see adoption of the service in terms of free content, but those same customers are purchasing content as well. And so there is a good attachment to it which we like.

And what we see Prime members doing not just within video content, but we see them doing a lot of cross shopping. So it is not surprising; we see them do -- maybe a customer comes and has been traditionally purchasing them pre-Prime in a few categories. We find that they do a lot more cross shopping.

Same thing with digital content. As they use the service they might start with free content and then they will also continue to view and stream free content, but they will also purchase paid content. So it is a nice effect that we are seeing which is why we like Prime so much.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Cantor Fitzgerald.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Okay, thank you very much. Two quick questions please. Going back to the international question, what it causing international media to decelerate? I think last year Q1 I think it was up 22%, FX adjusted this quarter it was up 7%. Is it all macro or are there any maybe other factors that you can talk about maybe specific to SKUs or something?

And the other is more of a clarification. I know last quarter you gave the unit growth in aggregate versus the unit growth of 3P. I was wondering if you could give that to us as well.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the international media growth, this quarter it was 1% on a dollar basis, 7% on a local currency basis. In terms of the overall growth rate, certainly what you are seeing is digital content as part of that is growing very fast, but it is not as large or as penetrated or ecosystem isn't as developed I would say as it is in the US.

And so, when you compare the two geographies for a second, that is one of the more meaningful differences that you see between the two is you see that both are growing digital content very fast, it's just the ecosystem is more built out in North America.

But again, certainly we see very positive signs in that given the growth we are experiencing in international; it's just on a lower base. So that is -- again, to be helpful there.

In terms of the unit growth, we said that our overall unit growth was 30% for the quarter. Our 3P unit growth -- I don't have the overall growth rate but it is growing at a faster rate than the total.

OPERATOR: Jordan Rohan, Stifel.

JORDAN ROHAN, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: I was hoping you could comment on the market entry and expansion strategy for Amazon in Brazil. There seemed to be a tremendous amount of press last year about it and it seems to have died down to some degree. I know the Company may already be there with Amazon Web Services and some Kindle offerings, but when do you think that might get a little bit broader?

And secondly, there have been some stories recently about an Internet streaming device box, a set-top box, something of the sort. Can you comment on any new hardware form factors including that plus some sort of a cell phone or handset that might be coming down the pike? Anything to look forward to in the Kindle family or related? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of geographic expansion, there is not a lot I can say specifically about Brazil. We think we are in the right geographies right now. We have expanded into a number of geographies over the past few years. That is certainly something we always look at and you should expect us to expand into additional geographies over time.

In terms of any questions related to our product roadmap -- we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we might or might not do there. But we are certainly excited about the product roadmap that we have for the future. And again, we have a long-standing practice of not giving details until closer at launch.

OPERATOR: Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer & Co.

JASON HELFSTEIN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER & CO.: Thanks. Can you give us a little more color around customer growth? I mean, that number has been slowing not dramatically, but that is a slowing trend? Are you focused more on higher value customers to drive the business and any color around the quarter would be helpful? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: We are actually pleased with the growth from a customer standpoint. We have seen very good growth and we continue to -- we have many, many teams across Amazon that are just heads down focused on trying to improve the customer experience and inventing on behalf of customers. So we couldn't be more pleased with what they are doing, and you see that reflected in our overall growth rate this quarter with revenue up 24% on a local currency basis and units growing at 30% on top of a strong growth quarter last year Q1.

JASON HELFSTEIN: Thank you.

SEAN BOYLE: Great. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon. com fourth-quarter 2012 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.

   TD
SEAN BOYLE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 29, 2013, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website.

You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to these measures, with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM INC: Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 7% to $4.18 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 81% to $395 million. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $3.79 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter.

The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investing in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. Return on invested capital was 4%, down from 22%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average of total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 470 million shares compared with 468 million shares one year ago.

Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $21.27 billion, or 23% excluding the $178 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers, who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and shipping offers.

Media revenue increased to $6.51 billion, up 8%, or 10%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $13.93 billion, up 28%, or 29%, excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up from 63%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded 200 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.14 billion, or 75.9% of revenue, compared with 79.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $4.45 billion, or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 293 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.2 billion, or 10.3% of revenue, compared with 9.3%. Tech and content was $1.22 billion, or 5.7% of revenue, compared with 4.5%. Marketing was $833 million, or 3.9% of revenue, compared with 3.3%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation, or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 23% to $12.17 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.9 billion. EGM revenue grew 24% to $8.5 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 69%. North America segment operating income increased 114% to $608 million, a 5% operating margin.

In the International segment, revenue grew 21% to $9.09 billion. Adjusting for the $183 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 23%. Media revenue grew 5% to $3.61 billion, or 7% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 35% to $5.43 billion, or 37% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 60% of international revenues, up from 54%.

International segment operating income decreased 61% to $70 million, at 0.8% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 56%. CSOI increased 47% to $678 million, or 3.2% of revenue, up approximately 54 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.

GAAP operating income increased 56% to $405 million, or 1.9% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $194 million in Q4, resulting in a 58% rate for the quarter, and a 79% rate for the full year 2012. GAAP net income was $97 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with $177 million and $0.38 per diluted share.

Now, I'll discuss the full-year results. Revenue grew 27% to $61.09 billion. North America revenue grew 30% to $34.81 billion and international revenue grew 23% to $26.28 billion, or 27% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, increased 6% to $1.67 billion, or 7%, excluding the unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Operating margin decreased 54 basis points, 2.7%. GAAP operating income decreased 22% to $676 million, or 1.1% of net sales.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.87 billion year-over-year to $11.45 billion. Inventory increased 21% to $6.03 billion and inventory turns were 9.3, down from 10.3 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.

Accounts payable increased 20% to $13.32 billion and accounts payable days increased to 76 from 74 in the prior year. In Q4 2012, we issued $3 billion of senior non-convertible unsecured debt and three-, five- and seven-year tranches with proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries; unfavorable resolution of legal matters; and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material impact on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q1 2013, we expect net sales of between $15.0 billion and $16.6 billion, or growth between 14% and 26%. This guidance anticipates approximately 122 basis points of unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $285 million loss and $65 million positive income compared to $192 million in income in the prior period year. This includes approximately $285 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other expense, to be between $0 and $350 million, compared to $398 million income in the prior period. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. With that, Sean, let's move to questions.

SEAN BOYLE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: Thank you. At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.

(Operator Instructions)

Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Tom, it looks to us that you have successfully begun the transition of your logistics cost in the direction of being more of a fixed fulfillment cost, with lower unit base shipping costs, given that the growth rate of up on shipping is now meaningfully below the fulfillment growth rate. So the question is, is that something that we should expect to continue now on the back of this meaningful fulfillment center expansion ramp?

Then separately, but on the same topic, we're also wondering, are there other parts of the business in which you can make this transition to more of a fixed cost in the future? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of fulfillment question, you're right in terms of, over the past few years, we have expanded our fulfillment network pretty extensively to the point where we are closer to customers; and you're seeing that reflected in our transportation costs.

You can obviously see the fulfillment expense is certainly not fixed in terms of in absolute terms. But you can see that we had the 20 fulfillment centers last year and that's reflected in the operating expense that you're seeing. But that is a benefit of adding to our fulfillment center network. We are closer and closer to customers, with a lot of great selection. You're seeing that reflected in the individual business gross margins, which shows up as benefits of transportation costs.

In terms of other opportunities, certainly there are a number of opportunities, as we invest in individual customer experience areas across the business; many of those would be on our website. We have a relatively fixed expense, as we launch those and we're able to amortize those costs over our full customer base. As they grow, they become more effective on a per-unit or per-customer basis. There is a number of opportunities that we have had and will have going forward to do that.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Just wanted to ask about the shift to third-party and in particular, I think last 4Q, you talked about shifting more of the business in the video game space in particular to third-party. Are there certain categories that you would specifically point to in this last 4Q where you made a similar shift? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: We did see a good expansion, as you've mentioned, in 3P. Our third-party units as a percentage of total units increased some 36% last year, Q4 to 39%, some expansion of approximately 300 basis points. Our overall unit growth rate for the quarter in total was 32% and our third-party growth rate was in excess of 40%. So, again, nice growth.

It is -- you're certainly seeing it in a number of areas. You see it certainly in our EGM business. If you look at our North America growth rates, you can see that our revenue was up 23%, but our third-party -- our total unit growth rate was substantially faster than that and our third-party units were growing very fast there as well. So there's a number of different areas that you're seeing that, but certainly you're seeing it there.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz with Jefferies.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO.: Looks like you're moving more in the direction of same-day shipping. Would you provide any thoughts or insights here? Should we anticipate a significant ramp-up of fulfillment center build-outs, particularly in Q2, Q3? Maybe you could just comment more generally on your FC build-out plans, US versus international. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: There's not a lot I can comment on in terms of our plans. Similar to last year, as we progress through the year, we can give you further updates on what we plan to do there. Last year, we opened up 20 new fulfillment centers and so we saw very rapid growth and fulfillment capacity last year. Stay tuned and we'll let you know more as the year progresses there.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: The paid unit growth deceleration to 32%; there seems a bit of a disconnect versus an active customer growth that didn't decelerate as much on a per-customer basis. Are you seeing some change in overall activity? Is that the impact of newer international markets? Then just on the investment cycle, the last couple of calls, you've consistently called out future investments, whether the $1.4 billion for Seattle or distribution center expansion. You didn't do it this quarter. I don't want to over-read into it, but does that mean that we're at the end of a major investment cycle? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of unit growth, there's not a lot more I can add to it. We did see very strong -- we saw a substantially high unit growth and revenue growth in terms of paid unit growth in Q4 which we're seeing very strong third-party growth as well; it was up over 40%. In terms of investment cycle, yes, I wouldn't read into anything related to that. We will still be adding capacity during 2013. In terms of the levels of how much we'll add, as I mentioned earlier on the call, I'd just stay tuned and we'll let you know as the year progresses.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: I was wondering if you could give us just a bit of a sense of what you're seeing as you roll out fulfillment centers into new states. Obviously, the sales tax issue has been one that's come up a good bit. But you've touched on the impact of being closer with faster delivery in those same states. Net-net, what do you see as being the impact on -- I'm not asking you to give us a state-by-state breakdown, but the impact of rolling out the fulfillment center footprint, taking both of those things into account?

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm not really sure how best to answer your question. We certainly have expanded pretty dramatically over the past, coming out of 2009, so between 2010, '11 and '12, we've rapidly increased our footprint globally. Your comment was more directed towards the US, but we've also rapidly increased our footprint in the US.

As a result of that, we're able to carry selection, a much broader selection, closer to customers, just with the, as you would expect, with this rapid increase. We've also expanded selection during that time period. So we continue to be in the locations we would like to be in and we'll continue to expand our footprint over time and become even closer and closer to customers. Beyond that, there's not a lot I can add.

OPERATOR: Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: From a high level, can you remind us the margin difference between 1P and 3P? I know in the past you've talked about you being agnostic between the two. But the growth in 3P and what your CSOI margin as would imply that 3P has a little bit higher margin. Is that the correct read-through? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: There is some variation by business, but certainly that's -- what we attempt to do is, from a pricing standpoint, is to try to be agnostic. That's certainly how we run the business. Again, this is on a third-party versus retail and then we've always -- also added certainly a lot of other services over the past year in terms of fulfillment. So it really depends upon where we are in the investment cycle, what our utilization is.

As you know, certainly as you look at the last few years, we've been very heavily expanding in terms of fulfillment capacity because of the growth that we've been experiencing. That certainly would put pressure on our overall cost structure, certainly as a -- on a per unit basis because we're not getting the productivity. We don't get the full productivity for a number of years after expanding.

So depending on what type of customer is, whether it's a -- excuse me, whether it's a retail unit, a straight third-party unit, or an FBA unit. But again, we're certainly attempting, at least on a product basis, to be roughly agnostic.

OPERATOR: Brian Nowak with Nomura.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTL: On the device strategy, with Kindles and Kindle HDs, can you help us at all with what you're seeing with attach rate trends on digital goods, after people buy the Kindles? Then generally, do you see a higher overall GMV per customer on Kindle devices than users on Amazon apps through other devices?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of attach rates, it's not -- we haven't given a lot of detail. But I think one thing certainly to look at, it doesn't give an attach rate, but it gives you at least a sense of the health of the business, is the number that was in the release today. We surely have a multi-billion dollar eBook business, growing approximately 70% year-over-year. That's total year, last year. That's growing at that rate after a -- really just launching the business approximately five years ago. So it's a pretty good, healthy growth rate, five years in.

We're seeing good -- I can't give you specific numbers, but we're seeing very good progress on a number of our other digital media categories. Video, I talked about a little bit earlier. We're seeing Prime customers, certainly the percentage of Prime customers who were watching free content through Prime Instant Video has gone up dramatically year-over-year. We've also increased Prime membership dramatically year-over-year. They are also purchasing paid content.

Those customers that are using the service, they watch free, but they are also paying for new content, which is great. We've launched a number of new services on the music side, most recently, certainly, our CD with free MP3, which we have on many titles. It's still very early, but we certainly like that service and pleased to offer it to customers. So I can't give you specific for attach rates, but the business is making good progress on the video content side and again, it's still very early.

OPERATOR: Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: As you guys build out the Prime membership and the SKUs available through FBA, you run into this challenge of increasing your unit volume of tail items. At the same time, you need to get products to customers in much shorter shipping cycles. So can you talk about how the new fulfillment footprint helps on that front -- is your reliance on air going down as a percent of total items shipped?

Then if I remember correctly, you guys reclassified some FBA revenue early in 2012. Can you just remind us how that flows through the shipping revenue line and what would happen as you comp that in the beginning of '13? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Just in terms of overall selection, as we added to Prime, what I was talking about earlier in terms of having a -- just a more expanded footprint is, there's no question that's helping us add additional selection more economically to Prime. So that's both in terms of third-party selection as well as our retail selection. So that's something that we continue to have the benefit of as we get more and more members of Prime and have a bigger and bigger concentration of two-day shipping in the US for that.

So we did add the shipping portion of the FBA fees in Q1 of 2012 and we see some benefit year-over-year. But we're still seeing leverage in terms of our, ex the FBA fees, quite a bit of leverage there. So we don't have the specific number for you there, but we're still seeing quite a bit of leverage there, ex that reclass that you're referring to.

OPERATOR: Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Last year, you reported 4Q in the lower half of revenue range and you were able to call out Taiwan and video games category. Any reasons why revenues were in the lower half this quarter and then if you look at gross profit growth, it clearly has accelerated to 40% growth, but unit growth decelerated to 32%. Can you describe what's driving that accelerating gross profit in the face of lower unit growth? Is it possible maybe you're letting the third-parties handle some of the maybe less profitable categories for Amazon? Could you talk about that at all? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: If you take a look at our growth rate, we're -- we think the growth rate for Q4 was solid. It was up 23% on a revenue basis, quite a bit higher than that on a unit growth basis, up 32% year-over-year. In terms of some of the things that we saw, we, again, there's -- we saw solid growth across many different categories and geographies year-over-year.

Certainly, some things to call out in terms of things that may have been a little bit softer. A few examples would be we did see some of the higher average selling price items, particularly the items that are greater than $1,000, a little bit softer. A few of the consumer electronics sub-categories like TVs, MP3 players, digital cameras, to some extent, were softer. But, again, with the base that we have in Q4, still very solid growth.

Another one, we certainly were thrilled to have Paperwhite in our lineup. It's certainly the best eReader that's out there and we're very pleased with it. But we couldn't keep up with demand. We would have had more sales in Q4 if we were able to keep up with the demand. So the team is working very hard to make sure we have good in-stock going forward on that product. But we certainly could have sold more in Q4.

OPERATOR: Tom Forte with Telsey Advisory Group.

TOM FORTE, ANALYST, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP: I wanted to ask you on Amazon Instant Video, how you felt about your current offering and your ability to add exclusive content in a cost-effective manner through Amazon Studios? And what the relationship is between adding more titles and uses on your hardware such as your Amazon Kindle devices? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: We'll continue to look at -- continue to expand our selection, both in terms of Amazon Instant Video as well as Prime Instant Video. We'll do that in a number of different ways. We think we have a very interesting selection right now. You should expect that we'll be spending more on content as it relates to Prime over time and we'll continue to add selection on Amazon Instant Video. Beyond that, you'll have to stay tuned.

OPERATOR: Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.

KEN SENA, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS: Can you talk a little bit about the non-AWS drivers within that line, such as advertising? As you look out, are there advantages to you in terms of having AWS, as far as offering things like buying, serving analytics through the AWS platform to advertisers? Where are you in that roll-out phase now? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the AWS business, we've -- the business is growing very fast. We've increased a number of services pretty dramatically over the past several years. The team's doing a fantastic job there and we'll continue to innovate on behalf of customers in that space. There's a number of other things that go into that line item, other. Some of the credit card, as well as other marketing revenue goes in there, so -- but again, AWS is in that line item.

OPERATOR: Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.

ANTHONY DICLEMENTE, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: I wondered if you could comment on the pace of business throughout the fourth quarter. Did you see a particular deceleration in the month of December? Second question, on international, I'm wondering are there any callouts in terms of specific countries that may have been weighing on profitability, countries where there's outsized dollars of investment going on, or accelerated investment at the current time? Thanks.

TOM FORTE: In terms of -- there's not a lot of specifics. We have a long-standing practice of not talking about trends within the quarter, and -- but in terms of year-over-year growth or anything like that. Obviously, the Q4 is very seasonal. December is, by far, the largest month followed by November, but in terms of individual growth rates, don't have a lot of comments there.

In terms of international, yes, there certainly are geographies that we're investing in heavily. Certainly China would be one. Some of the newer -- some of the European countries, including some of the newer launches we're investing in. So those are certainly -- you're seeing those represented in those segment results.

OPERATOR: Rohit Kulkarni with Citi.

ROHIT KULKARNI, ANALYST, CITI: In terms of your recent margin profile, that's truly comparing US and International, over the past four quarters, the vast majority improvement of other have been less worse margin continuing of -- seeing have been due to US margins improving, whether International was, planning in the range of 300, 350 basis points.

In Q4, international declined just 160 basis points, so my question is, should we read this as a big enough of a trend that we saw, how international -- how domestic margins increased over the last four quarters, whether international should follow the same route over the next foreseeable future?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, there's not a particular callout that I can make on that. The only thing that I would, in terms of the change I'm referring to, but in terms of the difference between the two, keep in mind that a couple factors, one, mix of business is a little bit different. Our AWS business is in the North America segment.

You also have some newer geographies. Our geographies -- I shouldn't say that are necessarily newer, but geographies that we're investing in heavily that have a longer-term horizon for returns, some of the ones I mentioned earlier. So those are factors as you look at the two different segments.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter with Macquarie.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: It looks like the first-party gross margin is actually up fairly meaningfully year-over-year. I wonder if you can talk about that within the context of how Amazon Kindle hardware is impacting the gross margin. Then separately, just any view on how video game sales impacted the year-over-year growth rates for the quarter? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, I apologize. We're not -- we haven't broken out the first-party versus third-party. It's not something we've done for -- not something I'm doing today or we've done in previous calls, so there's not a lot I can help you with there.

OPERATOR: Jordan Rohan with Stifel Nicolaus.

JORDAN ROHAN, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: The content cost for Prime Instant Video flow into the cost of goods line, even though there's no direct revenue associated with it, not into the tech and content line, right? Is that right?

TOM SZKUTAK: That's correct.

JORDAN ROHAN: Okay. So gross margins would have been even higher if those costs were included elsewhere or broken out separately. Do you have any common or -- to reduce the carrying value in your investment in LivingSocial, do you have a feel on a broad strategic level as to whether the local deals business through Amazon Local or through LivingSocial is something that you care to keep investing in? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: There's not a lot I can specifically talk about as it relates to LivingSocial beyond what's in our results today and what we'll have in our 10-K, which will be filed soon. So I would encourage you to take a look at our full disclosures related to that. But in terms of Local, there certainly is still a very interesting opportunity there. We do have a couple -- we have an investment in LivingSocial.

We also have a local business ourselves. So those are -- it's an interesting opportunity. It's a long-term opportunity and we'll continue to work on that -- for customers to make that experience even better. You should think about it not unlike a lot of the other businesses that we invest in, with it [budding] over long-term horizon and it's very early there.

SEAN BOYLE: Okay. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com third-quarter 2012 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.

   TD
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.

SEAN BOYLE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect Management's views as of today, October 25, 2012 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measure including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our third-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion. Return on investment capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares, consistent with 469 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion, or 30% excluding the $348 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and shipping offers.

Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11%, or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56 billion, up 36%, or 39% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales up from 58%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion, or 74.7% of revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology, and content and G&A combined was $3.26 billion, or 23.6% of sales, up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.45 billion, or 10.5% of revenue compared with 10%. Tech and content was $1.08 billion, or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million, or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.3%.

Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues up from 61%. North America segment operating income increased 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin.

In the international segment, revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion. Adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact revenue growth was 27%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange, and the EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5 billion, or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues, up from 54%. International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116 million.

CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million, or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year over year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased to 10%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million, or 0.2% negative operating margin compared with GAAP operating income of $79 million.

Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million, or $0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share. The third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share related to our equity method share of losses reported by LivingSocial primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets including goodwill. As of the end of September, the book value of our equity method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year over year to $5.25 billion. Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion and inventory turns were 9.7 down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion and accounts payable days increased to 75 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures was $716 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in supportive continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure including Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuation, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to actually predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q4, 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, or growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact on foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss and $310 million income compared to $260 million income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income, compared to $462 million income in the prior-year period.

We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that Sean let's move to questions.

SEAN BOYLE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: Thank you, at this time we will now open up the call for questions.

(Operator Instructions)

Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Tom, first on international margin, I know some of that actually is affected by currency and I was wondering if you could speak to the effect of currency that it's having on margin? And then secondly what else is driving that down, I would anticipate China investment, digital in Italy and Spain being contributors there. And then secondly, on shipping revenue up 44% year over year, I was wondering if you could break that down between shipping revenue or more Prime versus the change in the revenue allocation of FBA? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: To take the first part of your question, Scott. As it relates to operating profit in international, you have the big pieces correct. The first one is we're investing certainly very heavily capacity as you're seeing that both fulfillment and infrastructure capacity that's impacting our results there. In addition to that, we're investing in a number of new geographies. We've talked about Italy and Spain over the last several calls, those are certainly having an impact. We're very excited about the opportunity that we have there but certainly those are investments right now. China as you also mentioned is great long-term opportunity for us but it's certainly an investment and it is impacting that number.

In addition, one that I don't think you did mention was video content for international. We're investing heavily in video content through our subsidiary LOVEFiLM through Europe. So those are the things that are the primary drivers of what you're seeing in operating income in international.

In terms of shipping revenue, there's not a lot I can help you with there. There's a number of factors that go into that number. If you take a look at both the shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost, if you will, the net shipping cost is getting a little bit better over time as we get closer and closer to customers with our FC footprint. So those are some of the things, but again a lot of dynamics that are certainly impacting that shipping revenue number.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney of Citi.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Any comments on the paid unit growth deceleration that seemed to have been relatively significant, anything about the comp or any read into that? And secondly, given all the infrastructure investments you've made, Tom you just mentioned the shipping efficiencies, we're also seeing fulfillment as a percentage of revenue start narrowing a little bit. Do you think you've reached a bit of a cyclical -- investment cyclical tipping point or am I over-reading into just one quarter? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the paid unit growth question, it was 39%. As you mentioned it was a deceleration from last quarter. Keep in mind still the 39% growth is still growing at a faster rate than revenue, one. Two, if you take a look at last year's unit growth in Q3 the 53% that we had, that was the second-highest quarter that we've had in growth rate in last 10 years, so we're overlapping a very strong growth last quarter.

In terms of fulfillment expense, certainly as we've talked about over the past few years, stepping up very heavily in 2010, 2011, and 2012, from a fulfillment standpoint. We've just seen unprecedented growth and we've added a lot of capacity. In terms of where it will level off, we'll have to wait and see.

Right now we're still experiencing very strong growth with 30% growth on a local currency basis, 39% unit growth. So we're going to continue to invest where we need to and the fulfillment capacity we do have we're going to make sure that we operate as efficiently as we can and get more efficient with that capacity over time.

OPERATOR: Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.

HEATHER BELLINI, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: I had a question about pop-up stores. It seems like a lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon there and we've been hearing stuff recently about Amazon trying to leverage those as a way to get closer to customers and help facilitate shipping for the holiday season, and just wondering if you could share with us your strategy there?

TOM SZKUTAK: Could you elaborate on what you're referring to, I'm sorry?

HEATHER BELLINI: A pop-up store meaning something that might only be open for between say Black Friday and January 1, a short-term store.

TOM SZKUTAK: The vast majority, the highest percentage of our revenue is certainly coming from our online sales. We do, in the case of Kindle, are using physical world retailers as well, which we're very happy to do so. But again it's not really a driver of our business.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking my question. Tom, it's been nearly a year since you launched the first Fire devices and I was hoping you could give us a sense of how that cohort of users might be tracking in terms of their buyer activity and in particular how you're seeing them if they're over indexing in terms of media content, consumption, Prime usage and overall purchasing, and how do you feel about that strategy now as you continue to tie Prime into devices? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Maybe the best way to describe it would be certainly we're seeing customers certainly purchasing a lot of content. We like the idea of selling our Kindle Fires and then being rewarded through purchases of content going forward. All that being said, even though we're rewarded with those sales, customers realize we're going to make sure that we work on behalf of them to make sure that content is not only very wide, but also at great prices and so we continue to work to make sure that we can provide that on customers behalf.

But we're seeing very good shopping patterns on all types of content with the selection that we have. We're seeing customers not only purchase content, we're seeing customers, Prime customers, certainly being active in watching free content as well and that's working very well. So it's a great combination of things that are going on there and engagement with the device.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD: I actually want to follow up on that question that was just asked. So intuitively it makes a lot of sense what it is that you're doing. But can you maybe just speak to the effectiveness of selling the device or all these devices near breakeven. Is there any metric that you can point to to help us understand the lift you get either in terms of the frequency or of buying or lift in average transaction value or anything that could help us gauge from the outside the success of that strategy?

And then second, maybe if you could just speak to the thinking behind your content cost related to your streaming service going forward, just how should we be thinking about it? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: There's not a lot of specifics I can give you on a per device basis from a content standpoint in terms of what purchasing patterns have been. But as I mentioned in the previous question, certainly customers are engaged in a device, they are purchasing content, they are also in the case of video they're purchasing content as well as watching free content. In the case of books, they're purchasing books as well if they're Prime members, they're participating in free content.

So those are things that are going very well. We like what they see there which is why we continue to invest in that business which is why you see the offerings, the very compelling offerings that we have out there right now. So those are things that you should expect us to do more of.

In terms of the content spend, if you're referring to the related to Prime Instant Video I think is probably what you're referring to, we have added a lot of content. We like what we see so far. We'll continue to monitor it very carefully. You should expect us to add more content going forward.

We launched Prime some number of years ago now and we had a little over 1 million items at launch. We then expanded that dramatically with many physical items. We're now offering digital items through Prime as well as most notably and certainly in books and video and we're monitoring the performance very closely. But again so far we're seeing great new subscribers coming out of these efforts and we like what we see so far.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz of Jefferies.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO.: Thanks. I know it's still early, but have you seen noticeable impact from sales in states like California where they just started lightening you guys up on collecting sales tax?

TOM SZKUTAK: You're right, it is early. The only thing I can point to is we collect and over either sales tax or its equivalent value added tax, we collect. And over 50% of revenue today, we have very good businesses in those states and geographies that we do that in. So that's all I can point to today.

OPERATOR: Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.

STEPHEN JU, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Revisiting the capacity and infrastructure question overseas, anything you can share in terms of the operating environment and what is required to get the package to the customer? Over the longer term, are there any particular regions that you think may never reach the efficiency levels you may currently see in your older geographies? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Actually, we feel very good about the investments we're making in fulfillment capacity. When I think about the types of investments that we're making in terms of the predictability certainly I would consider the fulfillment capacity to be more of the running of the business type investments. We have a lot of experience starting up new facilities, operating those efficiently. And to the point where as you know we've extended that not only to offer that service for our retail business, we also offer that to sellers through Fulfilled by Amazon. So those are things that we feel -- certainly those investments we feel good about.

But what we are seeing is certainly just a very large ramp that we've done starting in 2010 through now. And it's one of these investments we only make those investments where we absolutely need to. But in terms of the deploying that capital and those resources, we feel very good about it.

OPERATOR: Brian Nowak of Nomura.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTL: Can you talk to what you saw throughout Europe? Did you see any weakening in the European markets throughout the quarter, and if so, any comments on specific pockets or countries of weakness? And then secondly, could you talk a little bit about social and your use of social networks like Pinterest. Do you feel comfortable working with other social networks to drive business to Amazon as you are now or do you think over the long term or time you like to have more end-to-end control over social eCommerce? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the Europe piece, we're not breaking out any specific countries in terms of growth. But as you can see from the results, we grew 27% in international in local currency basis which includes obviously our footprint in Europe as well as China and Japan. So we feel the growth has been in the high 20s to low 30s over the past several quarters. Certainly we're reading the same thing that you're reading in terms of the softness. Hard to tell how much that's impacting us. When you look at 27% growth rates still think that's pretty solid in the environment, but hard to tell how much we're impacted by that.

In terms of social, we're certainly very looking at a lot of different ways to reach customers and certainly that's an opportunity for us and something that our, certainly our advertising and marketing teams are very conscious of and working on ways to best monetize those channels.

OPERATOR: Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: You guys are hiring in Brazil for local content relationships for Kindle and some warehouse personnel. How important do you view that market in terms of the retail business? When do you think you could be in Brazil with a retail presence? And then fulfillment as a percent of gross profit showed year-on-year leverage for the first time in three years. Do you feel like you turned the corner on some of the capacity improvements? Or given the pace of new facilities that you're putting in, is there any reason why that would reverse back down again from here?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first question, we have a longstanding practice of not talking about what we might or might not do. Certainly Brazil is an interesting geography as well as there are others. And we certainly export to Brazil today, but beyond that there's not a lot to talk to. In terms of fulfillment, you are seeing a little bit of leverage in Q3 versus what we've seen in the past few years. Again it's one quarter. I wouldn't read too much into that at this stage.

But certainly we feel good about the footprint that we have. We feel good about a lot of the capacity that we've added since 2010. Some of that capacity going back is getting more productive than it had been. The challenging part is obviously we're layering on a sizable number of FCs this year on top of that that you're seeing the cost for. So there's again the 19 that we've announce the date.

OPERATOR: Mark Miller of William Blair.

MARK MILLER, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY: Could you share what you've learned with the add-on program and the purchase rate you're seeing? And do you think over time you can have a meaningful expansion of smaller ticket items and can that affect the percent of orders that have multiple items in the shipment?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of add-ons, our goal is to try to make products available to customers that we weren't able to make available to before. And so it's very early. But it's just one additional way that we can add selection for customers and be able to get it to customers profitably. So again there's not much more to it than that.

OPERATOR: Herman Leung of Susquehanna.

HERMAN LEUNG, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP / SIG: When you look into your holiday -- as you might go into the holiday season with your third-party inventory last year hitting a bump with video games as well as some of the Thailand floods, was wondering what type of steps you guys are doing to better prepare yourselves for a holiday season -- this upcoming holiday season? And the second question is wondering how we should think about the increasing cost shipping cost leverage as you go into 2013 with your distribution centers much closer and a higher percentage of FBA units? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of holiday readiness, we feel very good. As you can see from our inventory at the end of Q3, it's started. We're adding inventory getting ready for the holiday season that will happen throughout Q4. We're continually trying to increase our in-stock levels, so you are certainly seeing some of that already in the numbers. And we're very excited about the getting ready for a great holiday season and that's with our own retail inventory. Certainly we have sellers who are selling on our platform. We'll be doing the same thing. And we're getting forward to have a great experience for customers during Q4.

In terms of shipping cost leverage, I think there's a great opportunity over a longer period of time. In terms of providing what that would happen from a short-term leverage standpoint be premature to do that at this stage. But we can check in future periods and talk more about that.

OPERATOR: Anthony DiClemente of Barclays.

ANTHONY DICLEMENTE, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: On the North America media segment, just a modest deceleration. I would imagine that digital content sales and download to rent probably grew much faster than the growth rate of that segment. And so I'm just wondering if there's anything specifically that you can call out that was weighing that growth rate down in that segment, whether it's physical, media or otherwise? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: You've characterized it correctly. Digital content is growing very fast and it's reflected in the number that you see there. Beyond that, there's not a lot of call-outs with the exception of if you look back over the past five quarters certainly the highest growth we've had would be Q3 of 2011 which we're lapping, so that's the other factor. But very good growth on the digital media side. Also keep in mind that the growth of digital will also trail our device sales and given the new launches that we've had recently, that's-- that'll be good for digital content sales going forward.

OPERATOR: Michael Graham of Canaccord Adams.

MICHAEL GRAHAM, ANALYST, CANACCORD GENUITY: Tom, last quarter you made a comment that same-day delivery on a wide scale wasn't a goal. And since then I've got more anecdotal evidence of people getting a lot of same-day delivery, especially here in New York. There was some news from Wal-Mart that they were going to start shipping from their stores. Could you give us any updated thoughts or philosophy you might have around what's an appropriate amount of time to strive for to deliver to people?

And then as a quick follow up to that, it seems like every quarter you're guiding to 1% operating margins and just wondering if that a philosophical way that you're managing the business, is there an infinite number of things that you guys could spend on if you wanted to and we should expect this level going forward? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of same-day delivery or delivery speed, we have a tremendous amount of selection. And what I was referring to last time was I talked about with a large amount of selection broadly, that that's certainly challenging to do same-day everywhere; it's certainly a challenge from an economic standpoint.

That being said, if you look back over the past several years, we have added a lot of capacity. We have large FCs that are closer and closer to customers, that has helped improve our delivery speed to customers. And programs like Prime specifically has helped us get closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint.

What I would expect moving forward would be more of the same. We're going to continue to improve the customer experience in every possible way we can which includes getting closer to customers from a shipping standpoint, and we feel good about that. And again you've seen improvements in the past year and in the past several years and New York is one of those examples where you're seeing certainly shipments going in same-day in cases.

OPERATOR: Justin Post of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thinking about this investment cycle, it's been two years and a quarter and yet revenue's decelerating a little bit and free cash flow and margin trends continue to be down year over year. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the returns on the investments you've been making over the last two years? As far as return on investment capital, is the profile of your returns changing over time as you think about history? When can we start seeing returns on this as far as revenues improving or some of the financial ratios starting to turn? Can you give us any thoughts on how you're thinking about that?

And then just a financial question, US revenues for other were up 63% and then international was plus 15% for other and I think the difference is AWS. Is there any other big differences between the two geographies that we should think about? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of return on invested capital beyond the total numbers, there's not any specifics that I can point to right now. But what I can tell you is in terms of our profile, if you think about the parts of our business, the retail business I feel very good.

We have a lot of experience in terms of getting great returns for share owners. We feel it's something that we have again a lot of experience in as we've added new categories in particular geographies. Oftentimes we've already launched those in other geographies so we're able to learn from the experiences that we've had to date, so we feel good about those.

We have a great portion of our businesses and our media businesses converting to digital, so we've talked a lot about that and feel very good about the opportunity that we have there both in terms of making great devices as well as integrating content into those devices. So we feel good about that business and it's growing very fast.

In terms of our Web Services business, if you start with the core operation of that business, we've been in that part of the business serving Amazon the customer since inception. We've added a lot of new services that have helped both Amazon internally as well as external customers. We like the characteristics of the potential ROIC potential of that business as well. Our third-party business continues to grow on our consumer business dramatically and we like the ROIC potential of those.

We're investing in a lot of new geographies. A few in the last couple of years and on top of that China. China, you should think about that one as more of a long-term opportunity. Something that we've been investing in for several years, you shouldn't be expecting high returns in invested capital in the short run in that geography, but very exciting from a long-term perspective.

Italy and Spain, we're in investment mode in those geographies, but again those are more in line with some of the other geographies we're in in terms of time line for returns and feel very good about those. So hopefully that gives you some picture of a little bit of the landscape and how we're thinking about ROICs.

SEAN BOYLE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2012 financial results teleconference.

   TD
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.

For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.

SEAN BOYLE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2012, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Sean.

I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow was $3.22 billion, compared with $3.21 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital was 11%, down from 21%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares, compared with 468 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 29% to $12.83 billion, or 32% excluding the $272 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and shipping offers.

Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion up 13%, or 15% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.16 billion up 38%, or 42% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 180 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units, compared to 36% of paid units in Q2 of 2011.

Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $9.49 billion or 73.9% of revenue, compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $2.99 billion or 23.3% of sales, up approximately 307 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion or 10.1% of revenue, compared with 9.2%. Tech and content was $970 million or 7.6% of revenue, compared with 6.3%. Marketing was $521 million or 4.1% of revenue, compared with 3.3%. Now, I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense a line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.87 billion. EGM revenue grew 41% to $4.94 billion, representing 67% of North America revenues up from 65%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $344 million, a 4.7% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 22% to $5.51 billion, adjusting for the $269 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.25 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange.

In EGM, revenue grew 34% to $3.22 billion, or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues, up from 53%. International segment operating income decreased 91% to $16 million, or 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 74%. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to $360 million or 2.8% of revenue, down approximately 109 basis points year over year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 4%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income included stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 47% to $107 million, or 0.8% of net sales.

Our income tax expense was $109 million, a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a one-time expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate. GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share, compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.39 billion year over year to $4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to $4.38 billion, and inventory turns were 10.1, down from 11.3 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $7.07 billion, and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

I'll conclude my portions of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand; and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we do not conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q3 2012, we expect net sales of between $12.9 billion and $14.3 billion, or growth between 19% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $350 million loss and $50 million loss, down from $79 million income in the comparable prior-year period. This includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between a $75 million loss and $225 million in income, or between 129% decline and 14% decline. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. We remain heads-down focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks.

With that, Sean, let's move to questions.

SEAN BOYLE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.

(Operator Instructions)

Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Just one question on Kiva and a couple of parts, Tom. Now that you have closed the acquisition, you can talk about how you will deploy the Kiva technology? Is that for new fulfillment centers only? Or, can you use that in your legacy fulfillment centers? And, perhaps what type of operational efficiencies that could gain? Then, last part would be, is there any impact on our 3Q guidance from the Kiva acquisition, specifically? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of Kiva itself, we are very, very excited to have Kiva as part of the Amazon team. We are looking forward to getting great productivity over time through the use. But again, it is very early, and you'll just have to stay tuned in terms of the plan.

In terms of the impact, you mentioned Q3, let me provide a little bit of data on both Q2 actuals and Q3. In terms of GAAP operating income, in Q2 it was negative $25 million; for Q3 it's approximately negative $35 million. Then, on net income for Q2 it was a loss of approximately $65 million. So, those are the numbers for Q2 and Q3. But again, we are very, very happy to have them part of the team, and we look forward to working with them going forward.

OPERATOR: Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.

HEATHER BELLINI, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Hi, guys, great quarter. Question on the gross margin continues to climb up, and I was wondering if you could give any commentary there around how agency versus wholesale in e-books is contributing to that?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, the bigger issue is not that, it is related to overall 3P. There's a number of different factors certainly driving the improvement in the implied gross margins that you are referring to.

But, as it relates to 3P, it is on the broader 3P. So, if you take a look at from a units perspective, third party was 40% of our total units in Q2. That is up from 36%.

So, it is approximately 400 basis point increase as percentage of total units, which is certainly one of the factors that you are seeing there.

OPERATOR: Herman Leung, Susquehanna.

DEEPAK MATHIVANAN, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP: This is Deepak sitting in for Herman. The question I have is on the hardware business. How important do you think is the hardware strategy for the digital content, given that Kindle Fire has been out there for a while? So, could you discuss about the strategy on the business, and how it is driving the digital content?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. It is -- we're very excited about both the hardware and the content side of the business. We think, if you take a look at our devices, certainly it is very integrated, which is great for customers, so we think it is an incredible experience. So we're -- we've been very excited about the progress we've made so far from both the device and content standpoint, and we are super excited about the road map that we have. Again, that is -- we are very, very happy with what the team is doing there.

OPERATOR: Brian Nowak, Nomura Equity Research.

ARAM RUBINSON, ANALYST, NOMURA EQUITY RESEARCH: I noticed -- this is Aram Rubinson sitting in for Brian Nowak. I noticed the shipping costs were lower as a percent of sales for the first time in nearly three years. The driver, it looks like is shipping cost per unit, which fell about 10%. Can talk about how much of that might be attributable to the proximity of the distribution centers to metro areas, lower fuel, more favorable carrier pricing, et cetera? And, whether or not you see anything on the horizon that would change that course?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we are seeing -- there is a number of different factors, but certainly one of them is we're getting closer to customers and that is just with our wide multi-node filament network, so it is certainly having an impact on that. Again, we have a lot of opportunities to improve that over time. But again, it is -- the team is making good progress, and you are seeing that reflected in the results so far.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.

PAUL BIEBER, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: This is Paul Bieber for Justin. Going back to the gross margin question, I was wondering if you could give us some color on the relative impact of a few different things -- category, maturity, advertising, 3P, and maybe digital contents on gross margin, which ones are impacting gross margin more than others? Just a quick question on the taxes, what will the impact of sales tax question in Texas and California be on gross margins?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of your question on gross margins, we're not breaking that up; but certainly, 3P is having an impact, mix of business is having an impact. We have -- we continue to try to work with our partners to get even better prices on the goods that we provide for customers, which is certainly impacting it. Mix of business, things like AWS is certainly impacting that as well, given the growth rates there. So again, those are things that are impacting.

In terms of sales taxes, any impact that we certainly would expect to see would be included in the guidance that we're giving for Q3. But one thing to keep in mind, as it relates to that, is we -- right now approximately 50% of our business around the world, we either collect sales tax or value-added tax. We have very good businesses in most jurisdictions, so keep that in mind as you think about any upcoming changes.

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth, JPMorgan.

KAIZAD GOTLA, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: This is Kaizad Gotla in for Doug.

Just a couple of questions. Can you discuss the international media deceleration? It looks like it decelerated from 22% to 12% on an ex-FX basis? Then, can you give us an update on the fulfillment center plans for the rest of the year? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of -- I'll take international and total first and then, but the same is true for media. And really, I'll even start with the total business. Total business grew 32%. One thing to keep -- this is on local currency basis. One thing to keep in mind is for both the total business, international growth and international media, we had very, very strong growth last year, Q2. In fact, our total growth rate last year was 51% for the total business. And on a local currency basis, that was 44% growth. That is the highest growth quarter we've had in over 10 years.

When you look at that, when you are comparing ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth given that compare to last year. And that is some of what you are seeing also in international media, as you mentioned. International media was up 8%, on a local currency basis it was up 12%. Certainly, it is a challenging compare.

Also, there were some things just with -- some timing things as we launched with the unfortunate events in Japan last year. We certainly did have some releases that were scheduled for late in the quarter that, obviously, didn't happen that moved into Q2. Just from a supply standpoint, those are certainly impacting that region and some other things. Again, think of it in terms of the comparison point to last year is probably the best thing to do.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citi.

ROHIT KULKARNI, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: This is Rohit Kulkarni filling in for Mark.

A couple of questions. Can you talk about, or disclose anything about how mobile, how that is affecting your business? EBay talked about mobile affecting their growth rates, quite materially and perhaps even by a few percentage points, accounting for almost 10% of their revenues, maybe.

Second, can you talk about the broad philosophy of management about short-term profitability versus long-term growth? Probably, this is the first time in a while that you have blanketed negative (inaudible) in your guidance. How should we view your chart investment or the chart and profitability outlook? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. First, in terms of mobile, clearly smartphones and tablets are significant tailwinds for our business. Although we're not breaking out the numbers, it is a big tailwind on our business, and it is going great. We are seeing a very nice impact from that. Again, it is the tailwind that we expect that will continue.

In terms of short-term versus long-term, we're all about trying to make sure we do the right long-term things, for both customers and shareowners. But more specifically, around Q3, Q3 is similar to Q2 and other previous quarters in that we are investing, certainly, for the long-term. Yet on the flip side, keep in mind as you look at Q3 specifically, we're getting ready for our most seasonal quarter. And, we expect, given the growth that we've had, we are seeing very strong growth, so we are investing heavily to get ready for that.

In terms of capacity, for example, we've announced 18 new fulfillment centers so far this year. We've actually opened 8 of those already this year out of the 18. And, we're looking at potentially opening even more than that. I'm sorry, 6 open so far this year out of 18. So, those are certainly some things that are impacting our costs so far. And, you'll be seeing that heavier in Q3 as we get ready for the most seasonable quarter.

OPERATOR: Mark Miller, William Blair.

MARK MILLER, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY: I was hoping you could share some perspective on your URL expansion strategy? I would like to know some sense for the growth you are seeing there, and how material it is in your overall numbers? And, should we expect to see further expansion in those sites?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, there is not a lot I can help you with there. We're certainly looking, as you would expect us to do, ways to continue to grow, and certainly, that would part of our strategy.

OPERATOR: Scott Tilghman, Caris & Company.

SCOTT TILGHMAN, ANALYST, CARIS & COMPANY: Tom, I was just curious -- we have had a few quarters here where operating income has far surpassed the upper end of your guidance range. And, we had a quarter here where Europe definitely seemed to weaken as the months went by. I'm wondering what you think is causing that divergence between expectations at the beginning of the quarter, and how things are playing out?

And, just as a quick follow-up to one of the other questions, looking at the fulfillment center network, just wondering if you are satisfied with the fee increases that were put in place in February that that business is now matching the margin for the rest of the business? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm sorry, could you elaborate on the months going by? I wasn't following your question.

SCOTT TILGHMAN: On operating income we've had a couple -- a few quarters here where the numbers have come in far better than guidance, and we had a situation where Europe actually got worse as the quarter went on, so I was wondering what is driving that out performance.

TOM SZKUTAK: Got it. We, certainly as you look at -- I'll talk to Q2 since it is the most recent quarter. But, we had a lot of strength across many different areas. One of the ones I mentioned that helped our operating profit, as well as our gross margin, was third-party business continued to be very, very strong. Certainly, that was a factor. Again, there were a number of factors.

One thing too, you do see some timing differences to some extent between Q2 and Q3 in terms of our prep for Q4. You see that, not only in our operating results, but you see it in our CapEx. In the last -- 90 days ago, we said that we would spend approximately $800 million to $900 million of CapEx for Q2. We spent a little less than $700 million. You see that number for Q3 being $800 million to $900 million, as well. So again, those are things that you are seeing that is a little bit of a shift between Q2 and Q3 there.

OPERATOR: Ron Josey, ThinkEquity.

RON JOSEY, ANALYST, THINKEQUITY LLC: I wanted to ask you a quick question on 3P, and given it is around 40% of sales this year, items sold, what point do you believe the customer experience is at risk given the rise of third-party sales? And, any insight in terms of adoption on FBA by third-parties would be very helpful.

One quick follow-up on your comments, Tom, on CapEx, I think you said, came in lower in Q2, guidance is for another $800 million to $900 million. Is that guidance consistent going forward, or is this a one-time build-around technology? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the third-party units, certainly FBA is having an impact on that. That's one of the drivers, certainly, that is helping us have that percentage of total units go up.

We've looked at, and have been working very hard over a number of years, on improving the experience for both customers and for sellers, and FBA is an example of that. What ends up happening, is FBA sellers once they are part of the program, those units that are FBA in our fulfillment network are eligible for all of our programs, including free super saver shipping, Prime. Again, those are great -- certainly, that is a great program for customers, it's a great program for sellers, and it's a great program for investors. We think of it -- I don't think of it as a bad thing at all. I think of it as a good thing.

We have a lot of retail units that we send directly to customers. We are offering a great experience on third-party units, which includes FBA and a number of other programs that we have. Again, we'll continue to try to make that even better for customers and sellers over time, but it is working very well. Again, those -- the benefit of having third-parties on our platform is we get to add great new selection.

We also have competing offers directly on our detail pages, so when customers come they get to choose, in terms of who they want to purchase from. So, it is a competitive environment on our platform, so we think that's great for customers and for us.

OPERATOR: So Young Lee, SunTrust.

SO YOUNG LEE, ANALYST, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY: I was just curious about LivingSocial. It seems to be a bigger loss than usual. Can you give us some color on what happened, perhaps? Secondly, can you talk about the kind of traction you are getting with LoveFilm, given all the exclusive content you are getting there? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: LoveFilm business is doing very well. It is growing nicely. As you mentioned, we continue to add content there, and we plan on adding more content there over time. We're very excited to have that business a part of Amazon, and the team is doing great.

In terms of LivingSocial, there is not a lot I can add to it, other than what we have disclosed.

OPERATOR: Ken Sena, Evercore Partners.

ANDREW MCNELLIS, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS: This is Andrew McNellis in for Ken. Somewhat related to other questions that have been asked, could you provide any update to your same-day shipping efforts, and how that relates to sales tax and fulfillment center investment?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of delivery speed to customers, we are certainly trying to get geographically, always trying to get closer to customers. That is something that is not new; it's something we've been doing for some time.

In terms of same-day, we do not really see a way to do same-day delivery on a broad scale economically. But again, we'll continue to work on behalf of customers to try to figure out a way to serve them even better by getting product faster. But, in terms of same-day, we do not see a way to do that on a broad scale economically.

OPERATOR: Anthony DiClemente, Barclays.

PERRY GOLD, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: This is Perry Gold on for Anthony. Could you please touch on the online sales tax issue and how it could effect your build-out strategy for fulfillment centers? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: As I mentioned earlier, we do collect in several states within the US. We do collect in a number of geographies that have an equivalent value-added tax. Approximately half of our business, we either collect sales tax or value-added tax. We do very good business in those geographies. Those geographies are reflected, for the most part if you go back in the last several years, most of them have been included.

We have, certainly, added new geographies or jurisdictions that we collect during that time period. But, we've seen very, very strong growth even while collecting. So, we're very supportive of collecting. We think the best way to do that is through a federal solution, and we keep working with congress and others to try to get that passed.

OPERATOR: Kerry Rice, Needham & Company.

KERRY RICE, ANALYST, NEEDHAM & COMPANY: Hitting on the sales tax issue again, Amazon signed a lot of bilateral agreements with several states on the collection of sales tax, and I know there is a federal effort also going on. Can you talk about -- if a federal sales tax is passed, how does that impact your bilateral agreements with the states? Does that supercede it? Or, does that have to continue to go on with those particular states and build those fulfillment centers and things in those states that you have agreed to?

TOM SZKUTAK: There is not a lot I can add to that. Sorry, I can't be that helpful with your question, I apologize. But again, you're right, we do support federal legislation. We are working hard at that.

One thing to keep in mind, too, we price our products irrespective of what sales tax is. That is a customer obligation. So, we are pricing products very well. That's not something that we just started doing; that's something we've been doing for a long time. And, that's why we have a good business in those geographies and jurisdictions where we do collect because customers are coming to us because they want to have value, which we offer, irrespective of tax.

There have been a number of different third-parties that have certainly reported on that. They come because they want great convenience. They want, obviously, great service. And, those are the things that we are focused on, and those are the things that we believe customers will still want over the long-term. And, that's why we focus on those areas.

OPERATOR: Matt Nemer, Wells Fargo Securities.

MATT NEMER, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC: The International segment operating income has been under a lot of pressure. Is that primarily related to existing markets, growth in new markets, and would that be on the merchandise margin side of the P&L, or is it more of an operating cost issue?

TOM SZKUTAK: Keep in mind with International, it is a mix of geographies. And we're -- certainly, the sum that we are investing in, we mentioned certainly in other calls, China is an area that is growing very fast. We're certainly in investment-mode there.

In recent years, we've launched Italy and Spain. We are certainly investing in those geographies and like what we see there. Those are certainly impacting.

We are also adding a lot of fulfillment capacity. So, those are the things that are certainly impacting those numbers.

OPERATOR: Atul Bagga, Lazard Capital.

ATUL BAGGA, ANALYST, LAZARD CAPITAL MARKETS: I have two questions. One on guidance and the other one on Prime member. Can you help us -- can you give us some color on guidance, what you are (inaudible) for growth in international versus domestic. And, guidance implied there's some compression in margin, is it again mostly the function of the sales mix, or is something else going on there?

Second, on Prime members, can you remind us the profitability of Prime member versus non-Prime member in longer-term, and where you think the penetration of Prime members (inaudible)?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of revenue, we do not break out the segments, in terms of the split. But, if you take a look at our guidance, it is a growth of between 19% and 31%. And, if you look at the impact of exchanges, a little over 400 basis points, so rounded it is just under 36% on the high end and 23% on the low end. So, that is the range of guidance. So, we're certainly pleased with what we saw in Q2. We are certainly giving, as we have in past quarters, a appropriate wide range for Q3.

In terms of the bottom line, in terms of operating income and CSOI guidance that we've given. As I mentioned earlier, certainly a number of different factors, like the last several quarters, as we have been talking about, we are certainly investing a lot in the business.

But one thing to keep in mind is for the guidance in the upcoming quarter to Q3, and we are certainly getting ready, given the growth rates we've had for our most seasonable quarter. That is certainly impacting the bottom line in terms of our guidance.

As I mentioned earlier, we are opening a lot of fulfillment centers. We are adding a lot of capacity for both our web service business as well as infrastructure support, our retail business. Again, we are investing across the business, which is like other periods, but again we are getting ready for Q4.

OPERATOR: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back over to our speakers for any additional, or closing, remarks.

SEAN BOYLE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to Amazon.com first quarter 2012 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead, sir.

   TD
SEAN BOYLE, IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2012, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with our comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results.

Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down from 24%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 464 million shares compared with 466 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $960 million.

Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $13.18 billion, or 34% excluding the $56 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in the foreign exchange rate. We are grateful to our customers, who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection and shipping offers.

Media revenue increased to $4.71 billion, up 19%, or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $7.97 billion, up 43% or 43% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 60% of worldwide sales, up from 57%.

Worldwide paid unit growth was 49%. Active customer accounts exceeded 173 million. Worldwide, active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 39% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in the Q1 2011.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.03 billion or 76.1% of revenue compared with 77.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.76 billion or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 283 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.26 billion or 9.5% of revenue compared with 8.4%. Tech and content was $860 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $468 million or 3.6% of revenue compared with 3.2%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation expense or other operating expense line item.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.43 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $2.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 44% to $4.77 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 60%. North America segment operating income increased 20% to $349 million, a 4.7% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 31% to $5.76 billion. Adjusted for the $55 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 32%.

Media revenue grew 21% to $2.51 billion or 22% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 40% to $3.2 billion or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 56% of international revenues, up from 52%.

International segment operating income decreased 72% to $49 million, a 0.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 65%.

CSOI decreased 15% to $398 million or 3% of revenue, down approximately 170 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 14%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 40% to $192 million or 1.5% of net sales.

Our income tax expense was $43 million in Q1, resulting in a 51% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $130 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared with $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $1.17 billion year-over-year to $5.71 billion. Inventory increased 47% to $4.25 billion and inventory turns were 10.4, down from 11.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $6.89 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 62 from 66 in the prior year.

Our Q1 2012 capital expenditures were $386 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure including the Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes the financial results of the Kiva Systems acquisition, which we expect to close in second quarter of 2012, and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q2 2012, we expect net sales of between $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion, a growth of between 20% and 34%. This guidance anticipates approximately 240 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $260 million loss and $40 million of income or between 229% decline and 80% decline. This includes approximately $260 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $0 and $300 million or between a 100% decline and 22% decline.

We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.

SEAN BOYLE: Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator instructions) Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks, good afternoon. Hi, Tom, just a couple quick questions. One, I was wondering if you could update us on your plans for fulfillment and/or increases in 2012.

And then also Prime Instant video, you guys are over 17,000 movies and TV episodes now. Are you guys at a critical mass, or do you guys expect to continue to invest aggressively there? And one last quick clarification question -- the CapEx guidance, was that for the second quarter or the full year? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, I'll take the last one first. CapEx was for the second quarter. And the first question, on fulfillment centers -- in terms of announcements so far that are out there, we have announced 13 for 2012. And so, certainly, any changes to that, we would be back to you. Again, we are experiencing very, very strong growth both in terms of our retail, but also our FBA. We are seeing that in our third party growth. Third party growth increased in Q1 over 60% again this quarter. Again, a big piece of that is certainly FBA is doing very well. So again, we are continuing to invest in, and the number is 13.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi, thanks. Tom, I just had a question around the operating margin dynamics in the North American market versus international. If you look at it year-over-year, I guess, or even sequentially, the international margin is down pretty materially, but you had a significant uptick in the North American margins sequentially and just a moderate decline year-over-year. So wondering if you could just clarify what's happening in North America versus international markets. Is it 3P FBA having more significant effect in the US versus other markets? And then I had one follow-up question.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the -- we are investing heavily in both segments, but what you are seeing is, clearly, if you look at over the past couple of years we've launched a few new geographies -- Italy and Spain. We are investing in those geographies. As we've talked about in the past, China -- we continue to invest there. We think it's growing very fast. We like what we see. We think it's a great long-term opportunity. We are investing there, so those are some of the dynamics that are impacting international. And so we continue to invest again across both geographies, but those are things that are a little bit different.

In terms of third party growth, we are seeing very strong third party growth across international as well as North America, so pleased to do that. And we are investing again on behalf of customers and sellers as well as retail for the capacity that we need to do that.

SCOTT DEVITT: Secondly, on the employee-based growth, I don't know thinking about unit growth is the right way to think about it, but is there a point in time where you think the employee base starts to grow more in line, possibly, with unit growth? And can you maybe walk through where you are adding most significantly that's driving the headcount growth? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, we are adding a lot of resources across a number of different areas. But certainly, if you look at both year-over-year and sequentially, the Q1 numbers that you are looking at, the vast majority of that is in operations and customer service. Again, those are based on the hirings that we did coming out of Q4. We have a lot of -- we do supplement our workforce with temporaries in Q4. We did hire a number of those coming out of Q4, and those are reflected in the numbers.

And to answer your other question -- yes, we will moderate it at some point, certainly. But again, given the growth that we are experiencing right now, we are investing and we're making sure we have the right resources to do that.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citi.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Tom, could you just provide a little more color on the gross margin trends? And also it looks within that like shipping for the first time in a while shows a little bit less deleverage than it has in the past. Is there some sort of tipping point you have reached there? And just broadly on gross margins, that real drive up that you've seen over the last couple quarters -- is that just primary due to product mix shifts or revenue mix shifts? Was there anything else in there? And if you could also just briefly comment on Amazonsupply.com? Would some of that, all of the inventory that you've built up for that launch, have we seen that in the buildup in inventory and the reduction in turns, or are we going to see that going forward?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the -- we are not reporting gross margin specifically, but in terms of -- if you take a look at the relationship between COGS and revenue, certainly one of the things we are seeing -- a number of different factors there. Certainly mix of business is one, but another factor is certainly what I mentioned earlier, which is around third party growth. We saw very strong unit growth overall this quarter, up from last quarter. So we had sequential growth.

Third-party units as a percentage of total units were up approximately 300 basis points over last year. And we saw just great third-party unit growth, so it was up over 60% again in Q1. And so those factors are certainly impacting our operating margins, if you will.

In terms of supply, Amazonsuppy.com, certainly we have inventory on hand to support that business. It's certainly something that we are optimistic over the long-term. But in terms of the inventory increase that you've seen, it's very broad over a number of different businesses and categories and geographies. So that's really what's driving it.

OPERATOR: Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.

HEATHER BELLINI, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great, thank you very much for the question. I had two for you. First, I was wondering if you could talk about just over the last few years if you could give us a sense how much of the third-party increase has been related to agency e-books.

And then the second question is, in light of the DOJ case, I was wondering if you could walk us through your thoughts about the agency e-book model as well as whether or not this will mean we should see things move back to wholesale.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. There's not a lot I can help you with there in terms of the questions. We do think that the suit was a big win for Kindle owners, and we look forward to being allowed to lower prices on more Kindle books. Certainly, our unit growth, if you will, in total -- not talking 3P, just in total -- certainly the paid unit growth has been certainly helped a lot by e-books. It's growing, as you can imagine, very, very fast, certainly impacting that growth rate that you seen over the past few years, which has been great for us and great for customers. And there's not a lot I can add to your questions.

OPERATOR: Ken Sena, Evercore Partners.

KEN SENA, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS: In your press release, you mentioned launch of your Amazon Appstore. Can you just share any thoughts on current traction on Android or specifically off Kindle Fire? And what are some of the advantages and disadvantages you see for Amazon in that area?

TOM SZKUTAK: It's early, so there's not a lot I can do. We are excited about it. We think it's a very interesting opportunity and happy to do that on behalf of customers. But stay tuned, and it's early.

KEN SENA: And maybe one more follow-up -- if you could maybe just talk about any of the traction you are seeing within Kindle Fire more broadly or any thoughts you have maybe around a Kindle smartphone. That would be great, too.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the Kindle Fire, we are pleased with the growth that we are seeing. And customers are buying a lot of content and you are seeing that when you look at -- particularly in North America when you look at our North American media growth from Q4 to Q1, you are seeing that accelerate, and that's certainly a big part of it. And so we are very pleased with what's happening and we are going to continue to add more and more content for customers across all of our digital categories, and we think we have a great value proposition for customers today and we are going to continue to make that better over time.

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth, JP Morgan.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: I wanted to ask two things, Tom. If you could first just give us some more color on the outlook around segment operating income in Q2 and just how we should be thinking about the drivers there in terms of the sequential decline? And then, secondly, just the North American Media business, you saw good reacceleration from Q4 to Q1. Can you talk about the factors there leading to that acceleration?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, I'll take the second one first, on North American media. I just mentioned that little bit in one of one of the previous questions. But certainly our digital media growth has been great, and certainly it's helping that.

One other callout just to keep in mind -- in Q4, I had mentioned that video games, including videogame consoles, the consoles are part of North American media. That's a seasonal business that was bringing down growth in Q4, so it's also something to keep in mind.

In terms of our guidance, we've given a pretty broad range on both the top and the bottom, as we have previously. We think the segment operating income in the bottom end of the range is certainly appropriately conservative. But again, things that you should think about -- we will continue to add capacity, as we've talked about in the past, with the growth that we are experiencing. We are adding more. And as I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we have announced approximately 13 new fulfillment centers. So those are as a result of the growth that we are experiencing.

We are also adding capacity to support AWS and our retail business on the infrastructure side as well. So those are things to think about as you think about Q2 from a segment operating income as well as the CapEx that I mentioned in the opening. Another area is certainly our digital offerings. We are certainly adding more content and specifically more video content, which is reflected in our guidance. And so those are factors among others that you should think about.

OPERATOR: Gene Munster, Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: Good afternoon and congratulations. Another question on gross margins. It was obviously impressive results, the best in three years almost. And it's been a little bit of a roller coaster in terms of the profitability quarter to quarter. We understand that you are in investment phase and there's a massive opportunity ahead of you. But is there anything you can tell us as we think going forward over the next few quarters, just is the investment and philosophy that played through this quarter going to play on in other quarters? Or is each quarter kind of its own three months and it could go either way? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Gene, in terms of guidance, we are just giving guidance on Q2 today. But the one thing I would say is, again, we are seeing very good growth, as you see in Q1 and reflected in the guidance for Q2. And we'll have to star tuned to see what it looks like for the remainder of the year as we progress. But we are extremely happy with the opportunities that we have. We think it's -- we are in a great position with the opportunities that we have, even though we have reached some scale. We just have tremendous opportunities in front of us, and that's why we are investing in those.

OPERATOR: Brian Nowak, Nomura.

BRIAN NOWAK, ANALYST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTL (AMERICA): I have a couple of questions. The first was, I know there's a lot of focus on CSOI margins and margin pressure from the build. But I was just curious if you still see areas of your business and the oldest part of your business where you think you have inefficiencies you can still work to improve execution and kind of get some margin lift out of those in the oldest part of the business to improve execution.

And the second one is, any more clarity on how much roughly Quidsi and LOVEFiLM added to revenue growth this quarter?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of opportunities for improvement, even though we've made a lot of progress, we still feel we have a lot of room for improvement in all parts of our business. Certainly, the most opportunity is the newer parts, but certainly if you go back and look at -- we are still trying to get great productivity and putting together programs to get great productivity in each of our operations. So there's too, really too many to list here on the call today. But we look at it in all facets of our business in terms of productivity. We think there's opportunities to partner with vendors even more to get better savings and better prices for customers. So the list is long, but I think when you look at the opportunities in terms of the ranking, in terms of at least basis points improvement, start with the newer things that we've launched at least directionally, the newer things that we've launched, work your way backwards and those are usually where the biggest opportunities are in terms of basis points.

OPERATOR: Matt Nemer, Wells Fargo Securities.

MATT NEMER, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC: Just going back to the quote-unquote gross margin, is it fair to say, given the change in that metric and the change in third-party units that potentially the core margins in 1P really accelerated first quarter in addition to there being a continued mix shift to 3P? That's my first question.

And then secondly, can you comment on any product categories in either media or EGM that either held you back in the quarter or were a tail wind? I think last quarter you mentioned video games and a few categories in terms of giving some color.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, in terms of the second part of the question, I think in terms of any head winds, I would say there's a few areas, as we talked about last quarter with some supply issues that we had related to the Taiwan floods. That caused, certainly, issues, some issues for us, specifically in the areas of some parts of cameras, audio video, office equipment. And so you saw some of that impact in Q4 as well as Q1.

The good news for us with our platform is we have many, many different sellers. So where we had supply, we continue to offer those to customers. And in cases where we didn't, oftentimes we had third parties that may have still had inventory. So it certainly helped us very well to get through that situation. So those are some of the head winds that were in Q1.

And then we had very strong, broad growth amongst many categories, certainly in terms of the retail categories. And we also had very strong growth in Kindle globally. AWS is going very, very fast. So we had some very, very positive, if you will, tailwinds from the strong growth.

OPERATOR: Carlos Kirjner, Sanford Bernstein.

CARLOS KIRJNER, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: Two questions, if I may -- first, on fulfillment, if you think of the expected transition of your fulfillment network in the fourth quarter of the year versus what you had in the fourth quarter of 2011, do you expect it to be the same, higher or lower?

And secondly, on Kindle, now that you are a manufacturer or seller of Android-based devices, can you comment on your intellectual property position and the strategic and financial risks associated with potential lawsuits from competitors? For example, do you intend to go buy patents in the market?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first question in terms of fulfillment utilization, difficult to say at this point where utilization will be. We have a very good team of people who work on this in each of our geographies, trying to make sure we have adequate capacity throughout the year as well as for Q4. And it's always a tough balance. We want to make sure that we have enough because we want to make sure we satisfy customers. And so we will have to see as we progress through the year what the growth looks like. And we certainly, based on what we are experiencing so far, we expect it to be very good. And we will have to see what happens in future months and quarters to see what that looks like. So it's a little bit early to say what we think that utilization will be, but we are trying to make sure, any time we do this, to have enough but not too much. And it's a delicate balance, so hard to predict what it will be.

In terms of your second question I don't think there's a lot I can help you with there. We certainly have a lot of technology that we develop ourselves, and we have a great team, great technical team that's working in a lot of different interesting areas on behalf of customers and will continue to do so. Beyond that there's not a lot I can comment.

OPERATOR: Jordan Rohan, Stifel Nicolaus.

JORDAN ROHAN, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Hey, a couple points of clarification. I don't think I heard you blame macro weakness in Europe. Now, clearly you had stronger results across the board, so I don't see it evident in the results. Are you clear enough about the direction of the macro or its impact on your European operations that you can kind of say at least from what you are seeing it's not affecting you know?

And the second question is on this percentage of third-party versus first-party sales. Last quarter, I believe you said that it got up to 36%, in part because of stock-outs, due to the Thai flood and such. At some point, one would think that the supply chain for cameras and other things affected by the Thai flood would normalize. Would we expect that to, therefore, normalize back down from 39% level back down to the mid-30s? How can we think about that relationship?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, in terms of the macroeconomics of Europe specifically, we are not exactly a bellwether for the economy. And so it's hard to -- it's hard to assess. Certainly, it's having some impact on us, and you are certainly reading the same press we are in terms of what's going on, and it's very challenging. But it's hard to quantify what that impact is. So we're certainly having some impact, but it's hard to quantify it, is how I would explain it.

And then in terms of 3P, we have -- we've seen the dynamic that you are talking about in terms of -- it has helped us with stock-outs, both in Q4 and Q1, for sure, and it has helped growth. Where does it moderate? Hard to say, but we have seen outside of these two quarters very good third-party growth. And that has been accelerating over the past couple of years in terms of third-party unit growth. There's a number of different factors in terms of making that experience better for sellers. The most notable one is Fulfillment by Amazon, and so that's certainly having an impact and all the geographies that we operate in and have that in. So it's great for sellers, it's great for customers and it's great for share owners. So it's a nice intersection there. So we are very excited about it. And that's really what's driving it. The stock-outs and things are -- those will happen from time to time in various categories, and I think that's certainly one of the benefits of our model of having both first-party and third-party offerings. But I wouldn't view that as the substantial driver of what's happened in third-party over the last few years. It's, you know, other things that we've done to improve that experience with sellers.

OPERATOR: Lloyd Walmsley, Deutsche Bank.

LLOYD WALMSLEY, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Just had a couple questions around Amazon supply, and I guess first wondering if this is the beginning of a bigger push into the B2B kind of industrial space. And then secondly, what do you all see as your strongest assets as you approach this space? Are you planning to rely a lot on third-party for inventory? And then just finally, along those lines, the press release mentions the extension of corporate credit, wondering how integral this might be to the strategy and then, just more broadly, how you think about credit extension to customers.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the Amazon supply, it's interesting; we have been serving businesses for some time. This is just, again, a separate URL to help us do that with some interesting selection, we think, on behalf of businesses. We work very closely with a lot of businesses today, both as a customer on our consumer side of our business. We also obviously have a lot of third-party sellers that we work with as part of our seller business. So we are very excited about that. In terms of extension of credit and everything, those are things that we are working through, and we want to make the right decisions on behalf of those customers. And I can't add much to that today, but we certainly can talk more about that in the future as that evolves.

OPERATOR: Anthony DiClemente, Barclays.

ANTHONY DICLEMENTE, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: On the Kiva acquisition, I was wondering if you can talk about how you are planning on implementing that at your fulfillment centers? And does it require much incremental investment? And then more broadly, about mobile purchasing behavior, wondering if you could speak to just the purchasing behavior as seen from your consumers in terms of -- what's the order of magnitude and what type of mix shift in buying that you are seeing from PC to mobile? That would be great, thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Kiva, it's early. We haven't closed it yet. So we are very, very excited to be having Kiva and the team as part of the Amazon team. We are extremely excited to have that. And in terms of implementations within Amazon, we still have a lot of work to do, to figure out how and when we will do that. And so those are things that we will be working on. But we are very, very excited about the opportunity to join with Kiva. So we are very excited about it.

In terms of mobile, not a lot I can help you with there. Certainly, the mobile part of our business is going very, very fast. And it's a very exciting opportunity, and this is not something that's new, it's something that we've been working on for a number of years in a number of geographies. And we will continue to work on that experience to make it even better for customers over time.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: First question is on taxes. Can you help us at all understand what percent of your market places currently pay taxes similar to, say, off-line retail? And maybe any help on what you saw in New York with the tax law changes there, maybe start with that. And then one follow-up.

TOM SZKUTAK: Could you repeat the first part of the question?

JUSTIN POST: What percent of your markets, including international markets, are already on what we'd call level tax basis, meaning the taxes are the same for buy on Amazon versus an off-line retailer?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, so you're talking about the sales tax?

JUSTIN POST: Yes, sales tax.

TOM SZKUTAK: Assume that approximately 50% of our sales, we either collect a sales tax or a value-added tax. So we collect it in several states today in the US, and a large number of geographies outside of the US. So that's approximately 50%, so this is not anything new. This is something that we've been doing for a long period of time. And we have very good businesses in those geographies and states that we collect.

JUSTIN POST: Did you see any slowdown in states where they have enacted sales taxes, in your sales levels?

TOM SZKUTAK: I can't comment on any specific geography or state. But again, you can see by the growth that we've experienced over the past few years, which includes during those past few years certainly adding some geographies, if you will, to our collection efforts. And so those are all representative of the results that you've seen over the past few years and several years. So that's all I can add to that.

OPERATOR: Herman Leung, Susquehanna Financial Group.

HERMAN LEUNG, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP / SIG: Two quick questions. First, I know there's a lot of investment going on in the data center areas for your Web Services business. I was wondering at the current level how much capacity you are able to support, especially as you are signing on more of these larger type customers on the government side. And I have a quick follow-up.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we are ready for additional demand. The team has worked extremely hard to make sure that we keep up with demand. And so -- and as you seen over the past few years now, you are seeing our CapEx growing. As a result of it, you are seeing the operating expense as it relates to that and our technology and content. And so the team has done a very nice job in terms of adding capacity and is very excited to continue this fast growth that we are experiencing in AWS. So we're very happy to do that.

HERMAN LEUNG: And just a very quick follow-up -- I guess, on the GMV that's flowing through your third-party business, is there an opportunity over time to share with us the real power of just the third-party volume that's actually flowing on the top line?

TOM SZKUTAK: We have -- the best way to think about it, at least from our -- as it relates to our retail and third-party business, they are not -- it's certainly not one-for-one because you have new and used products, you have different category mix. But in terms of an overall volume perspective, as I mentioned in some of the earlier comments that it was approximately 39% of our total units. So it's very meaningful, and that's growing. It grew over 60% this quarter again, up from 36% of our total units. So again, I can't give you the GMV. But in terms of units as it relates to our retail units, it's 39% of total units, so it's meaningful.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Macquarie.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Given the success of the ad-supported Kindle, should we expect more devices to be offered with an ad supported option? And then also if any comments on the dynamics driving the increase in the shipping revenue? And finally, any update to the share buybacks?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of what we do going forward, we certainly have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we would do going forward. So you have to stay tuned on that. And in terms of the share repurchase, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we had -- we purchased 5.3 million shares, just under $1 billion, $960 million, during the quarter. We have a little over $700 million or just under $800 million left on our authorization that we have from the Board, which was $2 billion that we did some time ago. So that's left on the authorization.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, RW Baird.

GREGOR SCHAUER, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: This is Gregor Schauer in for Colin. I had a question about the Kindle Fire, which you guys have noted for the quarter is still the one best-selling and most-gifted product on Amazon.com, but it's still only selling on the US. Can you help us think through or understand what are the other considerations in terms of the timing of an international rollout of the Kindle Fire?

TOM SZKUTAK: I really can't. I think you just stay tuned. It's certainly a very interesting opportunity for us, and we know that, and you'll have to stay tuned.

OPERATOR: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.

SEAN BOYLE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to Amazon.com fourth-quarter 2011 financial results teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Sean Boyle.

   TD
SEAN BOYLE, IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2011 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO; and John Felton, our Director of Investor Relations. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2012, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-Q.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010.

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Sean. I will begin with comments on our fourth-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 12% to $3.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion. Return on invested capital is 22%, down from 34%. Return on investment capital is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.

The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $277 million.

Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $17.43 billion or 34% excluding the $101 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful to our customers, who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection and shipping offers.

Media revenue increased to $6.01 billion, up 15% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.91 billion, up 48% or 47% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 63% of worldwide sales, up from 57%.

Worldwide paid unit growth was 46%. Active customer accounts exceeded 164 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 32% of paid units in Q4 2010.

Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.83 billion or 79.3% of revenue compared with 79.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology, content and G&A combined was $3.14 billion or 18% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.62 billion, or 9.3% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $782 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $581 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 2.8%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America, segment revenue grew 37% to $9.9 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.56 billion. EGM revenue grew 51% to $6.88 billion, representing 69% of North America revenues, up from 63%. North America segment operating income decreased 4% to $285 million, a 2.9% operating margin.

In the International segment revenue grew 31% to $7.53 billion. Adjusting for the $102 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 29%. Media revenue grew 20% to $3.45 billion or 18% excluding foreign exchange rates and EGM revenue grew 42% to $4.03 billion or 41% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of International revenues, up from 49%.

International segment operating income decreased 46% to $177 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income decreased 46%. CSOI decreased 26% to $462 million or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 216 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 27%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 45% to $260 million or 1.5% of net sales.

Our income tax expense was $86 million in Q4, resulting in a 32% rate for the quarter and a 31% rate for the full year 2011. GAAP net income was $177 million or $0.38 per diluted share compared with $416 million and $0.91 per diluted share.

Now I'll discuss the full-year results. Revenue grew 41% to $48.08 billion. North America revenue grew 43% to $26.71 billion and International grew 38% to $21.37 billion, 31% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, decreased 19% to $1.57 billion or 21% excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin decreased 239 basis points to 3.3%. GAAP operating income decreased 39% to $862 million or 1.8% of net sales.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $814 million year-over-year to $9.58 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $4.99 billion and inventory turns were 10.3, down from 11.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 38% to $11.14 billion and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 72 in the prior year.

Our Q4 2011 capital expenditures were $550 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology, infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we have described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q1 2012 we expect net sales between $12 billion and $13.4 billion, a growth of between 22% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a loss of $200 million and $100 million of income or between 162% decline and 69% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between zero and $300 million or between a 100% decline and 36% decline.

We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks, and with that, Sean, let's move to questions.

SEAN BOYLE: Great, thanks Tom. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator instructions) Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: A couple questions, actually. First of all, on the Kindle Fire I guess, Tom, can you maybe talk about Kindle Fire hardware units? Or did you see an increase in terms of unit sales on a month-to-month basis in terms of linearity?

Second, as it relates to fulfillment, can you talk about what is your thinking in terms of getting closer to the end consumer and trying to drop delivery times to same-day delivery as you look forward in terms of planning and thinking of what's the optimal experience from a consumer standpoint?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of data related to Kindle Fire and actually Kindle itself, the only thing I can help you with is actually on the holiday season, which we put in the release. Our unit sales nearly tripled, it was up 177%, and that includes both our Kindle e-reader and Kindle Fire. So we are very pleased with the great growth we had. And obviously we have been growing quite fast over the last several years from a unit perspective in launching Kindle. So it's on a very good base.

In terms of fulfillment and delivery time, we are continually trying to improve all of our processes around from a customer standpoint. And that includes fulfillment and delivery speed. And so you have seen over the last several years where we have gotten closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint. And when we do that it not only helps our retail offering, but it helps also our third parties who are participating in Fulfilled by Amazon. And one of the things that you are seeing in our Q4 numbers is we saw very good unit growth. And you're seeing that we expanded our third party as a percentage of total units. And one of the ways we did that is certainly by Fulfilled by Amazon because, again, from a customer standpoint, those units are available for express two-day shipping or one day if you are a prime member and you pay the small fee as well as our free shipping offers.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: -- Two, if I could -- the first one, Tom, North American segment sales decelerated, and if you can -- adjustment for Kindle Fire by a pretty good bit. You mentioned third-party mix, which I think has a negative impact on that. I'm just wondering if you could just talk through the other dynamics as prime is becoming more mature in the US and/or the agency booked business, the mix shift of you're having given the strength in the Kindle product, if that's actually having a negative impact on revenue growth.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of our overall, I will talk to the total, the total worldwide as well as to the North American piece. What I was mentioning was our growth rate for global revenue was 34% excluding exchange. That compares to 39% in Q3 and 37% last year. If you compare our unit growth, that's a paid unit growth, it was 46%. And again this is globally in Q4, that compares to 37% in Q4 last year. So we saw an acceleration in unit growth.

On top of that, what we saw was third-party units grew 65% year-over-year and our third-party units as a percentage of total units was 36%, up from 32%. So really what you are seeing is you are seeing great adoption, certainly great revenue from a third-party perspective. But you're seeing very good adoption of FPA that has grown considerably over the last few years. And that is certainly impacting that number. Obviously, we only book a portion of the revenue based on the commissions we receive for that business and our top-line growth.

So that's what you're seeing in total. And you're seeing that also happen in North America as well as international.

And the other comments, a few other things to call out in terms of North America -- if you take a look at our EGM revenue, certainly there was some impact in certain subcategories related to the Thailand flood; it certainly impacted some supply. Again, the good news is we certainly had some good third-party offerings in many of those subcategories as well. Another similar effect is in North American Media. We saw very, very strong growth in digital media from books to video, music. All of those grew very well. We did see video games, which includes both consoles and games. Keep in mind that Q4 is very seasonal for video games. We actually saw our revenue decline year-over-year in video games. We had very strong third-party offerings, so our third-party growth was up. Our unit growth in video games was up, but our revenue was down, and that's what you're seeing impacting the North America media number, particularly versus Q4 last year.

So again, those are some of the dynamics. But again, what you are seeing is some of this, certainly the strong performance on third-party sellers was also impacting the top line because we just recorded a portion of that sale of the commission. But you're seeing it positively impact operating income, which is why you see it came in a little bit above the guidance that we gave.

SCOTT DEVITT: As it relates to CapEx, the run rate if you go back to '05, you were a little over 2% of revenue. And it has been ramping. I know some of the last two years this included the building. But we exited 2012, I think, at a 3.7% of revenue on a trailing basis. I was wondering if you could just talk to the way that we should think about CapEx percentage of revenue or otherwise over the next few years.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. We look at it, certainly, on an incremental -- from an incremental growth standpoint. We look at it versus incremental unit growth as well as what we think the NPVs for those specific investments are. But if you break down the individual pieces, again, as we've talked about in the last several calls, we have just seen such dramatic growth both from, first of all, from a retail perspective on our retail offerings, have been growing very fast. Our third party with Fulfilled by Amazon, very fast. AWS has been growing very fast. And so the capacity that we have needed to support both our operations capability as well as the infrastructure capability for our web services and our retail business has been very high.

That said, we feel that we are efficiently deploying that capital. We added, as we talked about last call, we had planned to add 17 FCs, which is what we did in 2011, bringing our total to 69. And again, that represents the high growth that we are experiencing.

So we feel very good about the investments that we are making. And with 46% paid unit growth in Q4, we are still experiencing very high growth.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citi.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITI: Tom, just a little more color on that North American media growth. You talked about the unit trends and the revenue trends in video games. Anything you would want to call out in terms of the other media segments, books, music and video? And then real briefly the share buyback -- I think this is the first time in at least two years you've done that. Any particular reason why you bought back stock in the quarter?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the North American media, again, across all of digital media, very strong growth. Another callout that I didn't mention is physical books. Unit growth was double-digit in Q4 year-over-year, which we were very pleased with -- if you think about the shift to digital content and just the really rapid growth on the Kindle side. We were pleased to see that. And then I mentioned the video games was, again, down from a revenue perspective. Third-party GMS was up strongly. Unit growth in total for video games was up. Again, there are some difficult compares, as you can imagine, with some of the console piece of that. And again, when I talk video games, that's both console and video games. Keep in mind that video games, in particular, is very seasonal and usually we see in Q4 -- we did see in this Q4 as well as other Q4s that video games sales for the quarter is multiples of what we see in other quarters, again because of the seasonality. So that's -- hopefully that's helpful.

And then in terms of the stock repurchase, we have had -- there's not a lot to comment there. We have said in the past that we'll opportunistically buy when we think it's the right value, and that's what we did.

OPERATOR: Jim Friedland, Cowen and Company.

Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Tom, two quick questions -- one is I think it's the new disclosure on service sales. Maybe I missed the footnote in the press release. Could you just clarify what is included there? Is that 3P, FBA, Prime, AWS and shipping? Or did I maybe miss something? And then secondly, can you share with us maybe your plans for how many fulfillment centers you plan on opening in 2012?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of disclosure I would want to guide you right to the release to see exactly what is included in there. But certainly, in terms of some of the big pieces, it is our third party. It is also AWS and a number of other service offerings. So those are, again, documented well and I would like to point you to that. It's also you can see that it's growing very well and it reflects some of the comments I made earlier about the fast-growing AWS business, the fast-growing third-party business. Service revenue was up approximately 74% year-over-year in Q4.

And then in terms of fulfillment, we added 17 new FCs in 2011. That's globally. We do plan, based on the strong growth, to add more in 2012. As you can imagine, coming out of Q4 we are finalizing our plans for what we are going to do there. And you will have to stay tuned, and we will keep you updated as we go throughout the year.

SPENCER WANG: Great, thanks Tom.

OPERATOR: (Operator instructions) Youssef Squali, Jefferies & Co.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO.: So going back to the media question, Tom, can you maybe just help us quantify the video games revenue impact maybe just on the level of deceleration? We would have thought that maybe with the launch of Kindle Fire, etc., we would've seen maybe a higher attach rate, and therefore maybe higher media revenue growth.

And second, just on the streaming service, any plans to offer separate pricing for the video streaming product? And that's it.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. Just to be clear, I am separating our digital -- when I talk about our growth rates, I talk about our digital content business is across the board grew very strongly during Q4. The video games, physical as well as consoles business -- again, grows -- is just seasonally, very high. It's not -- if you take a look at it, it's not too dissimilar to what you see -- what you would see with our electronics portion of our EGM business. It's a very seasonal business, very heavy weighted in Q4. And so that's no different than -- that's not different this year than other years.

What is different is our growth was down from a revenue perspective year-over-year. It was up from a units perspective. Again, the reason why was up is because we had strong third-party sales in Q4. Keep in mind, though, certainly console is a part of that. And again, we include consoles in video games as part of our video games line with the North American Media. And you have probably seen other press related to that as you look at other releases and updates. But there hasn't been a lot of new offerings there recently.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: How many videos streaming?

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm sorry. What was your question? Could you repeat it again?

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Just on video streaming side, trying to figure out whether there are any short-term plans to offer a -- just strip that out, basically, from Kindle and from the Prime and offer it as a standalone offering.

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, for digital video we have a couple of different offerings. One is a paid or rental offering as part of Amazon Video. We also have a service that's part of Prime. We like both of them. We have put some comments in the release about the growth rates associated with those.

And on the Prime that's in video, we actually like what we see there also. And so it's still early, but we like what we see. We are investing in digital content. We are seeing great adoption. We're looking at it very carefully to understand a lot of different metrics around that business, as you would expect. And it's still early, again. We really like what we see so far. We're going to continue to monitor it closely, but we will be continuing to add content there.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Okay, thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.

HEATHER BELLINI, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about any cannibalization you think you saw in traditional Kindle readers as a result of the Fire launch. And then subsequently, how are you feeling about the Prime conversion of the Fire units versus your expectations?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of both devices, meaning the readers and Fire, did very well. And we are very pleased with the growth we are seeing there. And that's part of the -- both are included in the growth rate that we had in our release, which is, again, during the holiday season. It was up 177% year-over-year. And again, we have been growing certainly our Kindle reader business very fast over the past several years, since introduction. And so it's on top of a good base. And so we are pleased with the growth rate, and customers like both the reader and the Fire.

Early to tell on Prime conversion. But again, early stats that we are seeing we like a lot. So we'll continue to see how that looks going forward, but we like what we are seeing.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you. Your headcount growth in the quarter was 67%, which is quite a bit higher than units or revenue growth. Can you talk about what all those people are focused on, maybe a couple of the bigger areas? And is there a day coming when you envision that slowing to below either unit or revenue growth? What is maybe the time frame on that?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. First thing is we are investing in a lot of different areas across the businesses we have talked about. That being said, when you look at that increase that you are referring to, the majority of those increases are operations in the customer service area. And so, again, it's in support of the growth. And certainly you are seeing it also in our operating costs. And, again, we are fortunate to have a lot of opportunities, we are fortunate to have the growth that we are experiencing. That's why you are seeing that growth. But certainly you will see that -- as you have over time, you will see that growth rate will go in cycles. But we certainly are feeding the growth that we are seeing and the opportunities that we have.

JUSTIN POST: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Jordan Rohan, Stifel Nicolaus.

JORDAN ROHAN, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: I am trying to better understand the guided range for Q1. And specific I am looking at two things -- first, the impact of currency and really more macro weakness in Western Europe. Are you seeing anything there? Is there anything that makes you think that things could be getting materially worse in any of your territories? And specific language around which of the countries you may be seeing could be quite helpful.

Second, I'm wondering if you are seeing or have seen over the course of the last quarter a shift of consumer buying habits towards the hardware device sales and away from media? Perhaps that could explain the deceleration in media that we appear to be seeing in North America.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of international growth, or in terms of, first of all, your question on guidance and the impact of exchange, we have a modest assumption around exchanges. Again, we are using the recent exchange rates. But the range for growth was 22% to 36%, and it was unfavorably impacting us by about 50 basis points for foreign exchange.

In terms of growth in -- you mentioned Western Europe. If you take a look at international in Q4, it was up 29% on a local currency basis. It did hold up pretty well, given, obviously, the challenges that are going on, specifically in Europe, from an economic standpoint. We are not -- we don't view ourselves as a bellwether for the economy, but certainly we are seeing that it is softer -- hard to quantify how much higher that international growth would have been. But it was certainly -- we are all seeing the same thing in terms of the reports in Europe, and it's certainly soft. So it is impacting our overall growth rate, but hard to tell how much.

And then on the North America media growth, it's actually, again, very, very strong on the digital content side. Physical books were up double-digit from a unit perspective, which we thought was impressive, given the shift to Kindle and, again, video games and video game consoles were certainly the biggest call out there from a negative standpoint. And that growth was down year-over-year on a revenue basis but up from a unit perspective.

OPERATOR: Gene Munster, Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: If we just take a step back and look at this from a high level, over the last couple of years you have been making significant investments in the business and it has been paying off with just some impressive growth numbers off of what have been larger and larger numbers. I think the big surprise for investors tonight is just what appears to be a diminishing return on that investment. And I don't know if you can use this as a forum to address that concern.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. I'm not sure how to answer that or exactly what you mean. What I would say is we have been investing very heavily, as you mentioned. And as a result of that, Q4 unit growth was 46% year-over-year. That's paid unit growth. And we see we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. And yes, there is some pockets of softness with -- or challenges with some of the economic impact, particularly in Europe. We did see some supply issues with the Thailand flood, with certainly some subcategories within some of our hard lines business as a result. We think those things will work themselves out over time. But we are incredibly optimistic about the opportunity that we have. And that's why we have invested the way we have and why we are continuing to invest in the business. So we are very pleased to see it and very pleased to have opportunities that we have in front of us.

GENE MUNSTER: Okay, so your outlook in terms of investment philosophy hasn't changed versus last quarter going forward?

TOM SZKUTAK: No, no. We are continuing to look as we always do. We learn every week and every month and every quarter about -- more and more about customer adoption. And we are looking at just a lot of positive things across the business in terms of adoption of our digital offerings, very specifically Kindle growth from a device standpoint and the content that's following that. And we are seeing some very strong growth along many categories. If you look at EGM, we are seeing very good growth in categories like soft lines, particularly clothing. We are seeing very good growth in consumables. We are seeing very good growth outside of some of the supply-constrained areas within consumer electronics. We are seeing good growth.

So there's a lot of positive things within EGM. Within our business, we are seeing just tremendous growth in Amazon Web Services, so very pleased with how the team is doing there. And they are just doing a great job. And so there's a lot of interesting opportunities that we continue to invest in. So we are very pleased and we are very pleased with the performance in Q4 and what it means going forward for us.

GENE MUNSTER: Great, thank you.

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth, JPMorgan.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks for taking the question, Tom. Just a couple things -- you are obviously building a lot into Prime with video and also the Kindle Lending Library. Can you just give us a sense of how the profitability of a Prime customer changes over time? And then also if you could comment more specifically on the early returns on the media rate -- media purchases as it relates to the Kindle fire owner specifically.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In each of our video -- excuse me -- each of our digital content that we are offering, whether it be -- as part of Prime, whether it be lending library or whether it be video, we just have early results. And so from a return perspective we are going to see -- what we can't see so far is what is happening with adoption of Prime members, what is happening with free trial conversion, what is happening with Prime memberships that we can attribute directly to those services. And again, it's very, very early. But so far, what we see we like, which is why we are continuing down the path specifically of adding more content to Prime and making Prime better. So that's something that we -- over time, we have learned both with our physical offerings and now, early on, in our digital offering that it's something that we think is very good for customers and very good for shareowners. And so that something that we are focused a lot on. Because we are investing a lot there, we are taking a very close look at and making sure that we understand it very well. And from what we see so far, it supports continued strong investment there. So that's what we are doing. But again, we will continue to monitor them very closely. And over time we will be sharing more about how we are doing there.

OPERATOR: That concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Boyle, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.

SEAN BOYLE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com third-quarter 2011 financial results teleconference. (Operator Instructions). Today's call is being recorded.

   TD
For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. John Felton. Please go ahead, sir.

JOHN FELTON, IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2011 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2011, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments on our third-quarter financial results.

Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 19% to $3.11 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $1.53 billion. Return on invested capital was 17%, down from 28%. Return on invested capital was TTM free cash flow, divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter end.

The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares, compared with 465 million shares.

Worldwide revenue grew 44% to $10.88 billion, or 39% excluding the $371 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.

We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $4.15 billion, up 24%, or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $6.32 billion, up 59%, or 54% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 58% of worldwide sales, up from 53%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 53%.

Active customer accounts exceeded 152 million. Worldwide active sellers were more than 2 million.

Now, I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $8.32 billion, or 76.5% of revenue, consistent with the prior-year period. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $2.29 billion, or 21.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year over year.

Fulfillment was $1.09 billion, or 10% of revenue, compared with 8.7%. Tech and content was $694 million, or 6.4% of revenue, compared with 5.1%. Marketing was $360 million, or 3.3% of revenue, compared with 3.1%.

Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate segments our stock-based compensation or other operating-expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 44% to $5.93 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $1.93 billion. EGM revenue grew 56% to $3.64 billion, representing 61% of North American revenues, up from 56%. North America segment operating income decreased 23% to $144 million, a 2.4% operating margin.

In the international segment, revenue grew 44% to $4.94 billion. Adjusting for the $367 million year-over-year favorable foreign-exchange impact, revenue growth was 33%.

Media revenue grew 27% to $2.23 billion, or 17% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 63% to $2.68 billion, or 51% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international revenues, up from 48%.

International segment operating income decreased 46% to $116 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 55%.

Consolidated segment operating income decreased 35% to $260 million, or 2.4% of revenue, down approximately 290 basis points year over year. Excluding the $14 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 38%.

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 71% to $79 million, or 0.7% of net sales.

Our income-tax expense was $67 million in Q3, resulting in a 52% rate for the quarter and a 31% rate year to date. GAAP net income was $63 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $231 million and $0.51 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $441 million year over year to $6.33 billion. Inventory increased 50% to $3.77 billion and inventory turns were 10.8, down from 11.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 42% to $6.55 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 72 from 73 days in the prior year.

Our Q3 2011 capital expenditures were $529 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web services, and capacity to support our fulfillment operations.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange-rate fluctuation, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.

Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign-exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q4 2011, we expect net sales between $16.45 billion and $18.65 billion, or growth between 27% and 44%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange.

GAAP operating income or loss to be between $200 million loss and $250 million of income, or between a 142% decline and 47% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between zero and $450 million, or between 100% decline and 28% decline.

We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks, and with that, John, let's move to questions.

JOHN FELTON: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Mark Mahaney, Citigroup.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: I wonder if you would talk a little bit more about the revenue guide for the fourth quarter and just some basic factual things. Are you including contributions from the Kindle Fire shipments, and do you fully recognize all of that or is there some ratable recognition? And is there any particular reason in addition to that that you were guiding for a deceleration? Are you seeing signs of softening consumer demand in European markets, for example? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the guidance for revenue for Q4, as we have done in previous years, we have given a wide range of guidance in Q4 just because of the seasonality and difficult to predict.

But we feel very good about the demand that we've seen to date, and certainly at the high end of the guidance, you can see there's an acceleration that's possible. It's reflected in that guidance. But we are giving a wide range consistent with what we have done in prior Q4s.

In terms of the overall growth that we've seen so far to date, you saw very strong growth in Q3, up 39% on a local-currency basis. That's consistent with what we have seen over the past 12 months where we're up 39% also over the trailing 12 months, and you know, we really saw a step change two years ago where last year we grew 40% year over year. So far last 12 months, we're up 39%. So again, we feel very good about the growth we are experiencing, and all the trends that we've seen to date are reflecting the guidance, so we're giving a wide range.

In terms of Kindle Fire and Kindle products, it certainly is included in our guidance, it's really the largest portion of that would be reflected in our revenue.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Jefferies & Company.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Thank you very much. Tom, could you please speak to what is pressuring margins in Q3 and particularly Q4? I guess the implied margin for Q4 is effectively zero at the midpoint. It again begs to the question, what's the financial model going forward? Is it to try to maximize growth at the top line, even at zero growth -- at zero margin? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: What you're seeing -- and again, it relates back to the growth. We are seeing really unprecedented growth. We're seeing the best growth rates we've seen since 2000, meaning in 2010 and so far over the past 12 months, you know, ending September.

So with this strong growth, we're investing in a lot of capacity, and that's what we've been talking about over the past couple of quarters and that's what you're seeing in our Q3 results specifically. If you take a look at our operating expenses in Q3 as a percentage of revenue, you see -- and if you compare that to Q2, as a percentage of revenue you're seeing very similar trends for marketing and G&A. You're seeing a slight uptick in tech and content. It's about 10 basis points, and then you're seeing fulfillment up approximately 80 basis points.

The reason why that's growing so much as a percentage of revenue is again the capacity that we've been talking about. 90 days ago, I mentioned that we were -- we had announced 15 new fulfillment centers this year. That's on a base of 52 from last year, and that we'd likely open one or two more. We are actually going to be opening 17 new fulfillment centers, and so you're seeing that impacting our fulfillment expense in Q3, as well as the bottom line in Q3. So that's what's impacting us in Q3.

We're also investing in a number of different areas. We're investing to support retail growth fulfilled by Amazon growth, the fast-growing AWS business, as well as infrastructure to support our retail business. We're investing in our Kindle and digital business, and you're seeing that reflected in our Q4 guidance as well, all of these things.

So if you take a look at our Kindle business, for example, we launched four new products at the end of September and we're very, very excited about these products. They are at great prices and they're certainly premium products. And so, we're very excited about those.

And when you think about the economics of the Kindle business, we think about it in totality. We think of the lifetime value of those devices. So we're not just thinking about the economics of the device and the accessories; we're thinking about the content. We are selling quite a bit of special offers devices, which includes ads, so we're thinking about the advertisement and those special offers and those lifetime values.

So, those are the things certainly that are impacting, as well as investments in other areas impacting our Q4 guidance. But we feel very good about where we are right now and the opportunities that we have in front of us.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks, Tom. Just a bigger picture question on the retail business. I was wondering how you're thinking about individual markets in cases where specific markets are highly competitive and in markets where you may be positioned potentially as a number two. Do you -- long term in markets such as that, do you believe that the business should be positioned as a number one and that the scale advantages deteriorate if you're not a number one? Just wondering given some of the emerging markets and the competitive landscape that's occurring, particularly in Asia, how you think about that. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. You know, we're -- maybe to step back from it a bit, whenever we enter a new geography or even a new category, we're trying to make sure that it's something that we can -- we think we can add value to.

And so, for example, we like categories that have a lot of different SKUs, that are complicated at a physical retail environment. We like categories where there is -- we think that we can add a lot of value from a service perspective. And so, in each of the categories we operate in, we're always trying to make sure that we can -- we think we can get great returns on invested capital over a period of time.

And so, I am not directly answering your question, but we certainly look at it on a category-by-category basis. We look at where we can add value, and if you look back over our history, you can see where we have entered new categories and new geographies, we've always started with the customer first. We have added selection usually first from a retail standpoint, sometimes with third parties it starts, sometimes not, but we've added third parties as we've gone, if we haven't done it when we started.

And so, this -- we think this model has worked very well for us. And again, we're looking always that way so we can add value for customers and shareholders over time.

OPERATOR: Jim Friedland, Cowen and Company.

JIM FRIEDLAND, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Thanks. I wanted to ask about -- with Netflix launching or announcing that they're launching in the UK and Ireland with streaming. You guys bought LOVEFiLM earlier in the year, and it doesn't seem like you've changed the streaming side of the business that much. Are there any plans to ramp up the investment in content outside the U.S., outside of what you're doing with Prime streaming?

And then on Quidsi, we've seen a lot of new announcements in terms of new brands and also new categories. Is that having a material impact on some of the lower operating profit, or is Quidsi just not big enough as a percentage of total to matter?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of LOVEFiLM, actually we have been investing in content since acquisition, so that's something we have been doing, and we continue to invest there and you should expect us to continue to invest in LOVEFiLM.

We think it's a great opportunity. The business is doing very well. We're very pleased with how the team is working and we're very excited about that opportunity. So that's something we have been doing since acquisition, and you should expect that to continue.

In terms of Quidsi, yes, they are continuing to expand, doing a very nice job. That is not -- as certainly reflected in the guidance that we're giving for Q4, I wouldn't consider that a material impact.

OPERATOR: Ross Sandler, RBC Capital Markets.

ROSS SANDLER, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks, guys, just two quick questions. First on U.S. EGM. There was a bit more deceleration there than prior quarters. I know the comp was more challenging, but can you give us a little color on what's going on with the deceleration in domestic EGM?

And then, a question on mobile. Are smartphone and tablet users that are buying physical goods on the Amazon Mobile app, how does their purchase behavior differ from the same users who are buying stuff on PC? Are they buying more physical goods or less? Not e-books or digital goods, but just specifically physical goods. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, in terms of the first part of your question, we are very pleased with the growth rate we saw, and North America EGM was up 56% year over year. And you do have it right, it is a bit of a tough compare if you look back to last year. We did grow 80%. It was certainly a high watermark for us and we're overlapping that. We had very, very strong growth last year Q3. But again, still very pleased with what we see in Q3 of this year and EGM specifically and our overall growth rates, too.

In terms of mobile, we actually haven't released a lot of details in that, so there's not much I can help you with there, but certainly we are seeing good trends in our mobile business. And again, we like what we're seeing there, but there's not much I can help you with on that particular question.

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Great, a couple of questions. First of all, I guess, on lifetime value. If you look at the Kindle customer versus the core retail customer, can you talk about whether lifetime value is comparable or higher relative to that core business, if you can isolate it that way?

And second, as you look at the third-party business, are you seeing an accelerated mix shift towards third party broadly, and is there any particular markets or international that seems to be seeing a bigger pickup in the third-party side of the business?

TOM SZKUTAK: To answer the first part of your question, we're not breaking out Kindle customer versus non-Kindle customer, but I can talk a little bit about some of the dynamics related specifically to the Kindle customer.

You know, we have learned a lot over the past couple of years about -- since launching Kindle. Once a customer has purchased a device, obviously what else do they buy, and with the launch more recently of special offers and ad-based Kindles, we certainly have some data. We're still learning, but have some data there that we didn't have prior to launch.

And so, what we're seeing certainly is that once customers purchase a Kindle and are carrying around this really massive selection at their fingertips, they're buying more content. We've talked a lot about that on previous calls.

But again, as we think about the lifetime value, we're thinking very specifically about the device itself, how to make sure that we get just the absolute device in customers -- the absolute best device in customers' hands and have the absolute best content on those devices. And we look at the total economics, which include the device, the accessories, the content, as well as any -- the ad-based revenue and special offers. So those are the things that we're looking at as we think about the lifetime value of a device, and we like what we see.

And so, certainly as you think about Q4 and you think about the guidance that we're giving, certainly we're going to have a -- we expect to have a record quarter in terms of device sales. And because of the backend loading of it, you should assume that the content would obviously trail that device sale. The ad revenue would trail those device sales, as well as the special offers. So those are things you should think about as you think about our Kindle business.

But we're extremely excited about it, both our electronic ink and Fire devices, and couldn't be more pleased to offer those for customers, and we think that those will be great for shareowners over time.

In terms of third party, we think the business is going very well in terms of the numbers. You know, our third-party units as a percentage of total units, these are paid units as a percentage of total units, is 38% this quarter, up from 35% last year, so we're very pleased. Also on top have very strong overall unit growth. So we're very pleased with what we are seeing there. This is a trend that has been -- you have seen for a number of years now where we're getting both great retail growth, as well as third-party growth, and certainly fulfilled by Amazon and other things at helping drive that growth rate.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So I guess one question in a couple of parts related to digital content. Tom, I was wondering if you could just perhaps give us a sense of how much of an increase in operating costs in the fourth quarter do you think will be driven by digital content rights? Should we expect that to continue to drag on into 2012?

And then, just to clarify, how are you accounting for the streaming content [rights]? Is that under FAS 63? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of content, we will be certainly purchasing content for both our U.S. business, which includes a paid piece and a prime instant video, which would be an unpaid piece, free as long as you are a prime member. And so, those -- so the content is included in our Q4.

In addition to that, we also have content costs as we have with LOVEFiLM in Europe, so those are included in our guidance. We're not splitting out the specific dollar amount related to that in our guidance for Q4, but it's certainly impacting our guidance along with certainly investing in our Kindle business and some of the other investments that I talked about. So those are the things that are impacting us, and we're excited for those opportunities.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Macquarie Group.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: So my understanding is that Google will be the default search engine for the Kindle Fire, but will the Silk browser have any type of interface or search bar that links directly to either physical product or media directly from Amazon?

And then, just separately, on the video distribution, you're still not on the game consoles. Any update on why, and would you consider deploying any device like a Roku box or anything else directly to Prime customers so that they can get video content to a [television]? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: It will be very easy on Fire to access all of our digital content. That's first. So it's a very integrated device. It's something that we've been working on. It's coming together over a long period of time in terms of being able to offer just a vast amount of paid and free content in the case of video. We'll certainly have book content, music content. So it will be very -- our app store as well. So it will be very easy and very integrated being able to access all of our digital content.

It will also be easy to access physical product as well. So those are things that we're very excited about, and customers will be able to see, you know, when they receive their Fire. And so, we think this is -- it's an incredible product. We're very excited about it. It's certainly a premium product, and at $199, it's certainly not a premium price. We're very happy to offer that to customers.

In terms of other things we might do, I don't have anything to speak of there.

OPERATOR: Herman Leung, Susquehanna.

HERMAN LEUNG, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP/SIG: Hi, thanks, two quick questions. First, I guess, on the Target cost drop. I think Target is dropping basically in August. So, wondering what the impact of that is from a one-time cost standpoint in the third and fourth quarters.

And then, the second quick question is on the distribution center ramp. The 17 new distribution centers that you're adding, how long would it take for those distribution centers to operate at normalized levels similar to your 52 other distribution centers? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Target, we are not breaking out any specific partner relationship, but certainly in terms of the -- you have the timing right in terms of that did happen during Q3.

We were very fortunate to be able to be -- to partner with Target over a number of years, and so we're very happy to have done that, and I'm sure that relationship ended from a [powering] their website in Q3, and any associated impact has been reflected in our actual results for Q3 and our guidance for Q4.

And then, in terms of the FCs, the way you should think about it is think about just the share ramp-up of going from 52 to 69 FCs in a year. It's happening very fast. We have a fantastic team around the world who's been working very hard making sure that we're up and running and we have all of our associates trained.

That being said, as you can imagine, we're having people come in well before, starting fulfillment for training. We are signing leases and getting product available for shipment well before doing so.

And so, consequently, just as a result of having a ramp up where there'll be no output for some period of time, even though we'll have people and buildings in place and receiving product in, is productive downtime. Then there's a timeframe where it takes to ramp up during -- from a distribution standpoint. So all of these things will take time.

It's something that we have been doing since the start of Amazon. It's something that I think we understand very well and it takes a period of time, depending upon the FC and how automated it is or non-automated it is. So all of those factors, we certainly understand well. And we'll certainly -- I feel very good about deploying those assets and getting great returns on invested capital in those assets over time.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, UBS.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, UBS: Great, thanks. Two quick questions. Would you provide any color on current traction with the Cloud player and/or usage of Prime video? And going forward, is there any chance that we could see the video service unbundled from Prime, perhaps with stand-alone fee? I know it's kind of a forward look, but just how can we think about that? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: We're happy with the traction we're getting, both the Cloud player and Prime video. Both are very early.

In terms of Prime video, customers absolutely love it. It is free video. We are adding a lot of content there. We have a lot of customers who are requesting free trials, and then they're converting based on those free trials. This is the Prime trials, and so it is very early and it's something that we'll be adding to, certainly, over the course of the next 12 months, and we feel very good about that.

But we're also monitoring it very carefully and we're watching all the customer-facing metrics that we can, as well as looking at the economics of it. But we feel that it's very early, but we like what we see so far.

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth, JPMorgan.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thanks for taking the question. Two things. First, Tom, we've seen in the past sometimes when companies make changes to the site in terms of the UI, that it can take customers a little time to get adjusted to those. Can you comment on what you're seeing in the early impact on your side and how that plays into the Q4, if it does at

And then, secondly, can you comment on whether you're paying any royalties around the Kindle Fire?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the UI, there's not a lot I can say there. Certainly that's -- probably the most recent data would be to look at our Q3 results. We didn't have the new UI at 100% for the full quarter, but again, we saw very strong growth rate in Q3, as I had mentioned earlier, up 39%. So we feel very good about it, and it's certainly reflected in our actual results and our guidance, as I mentioned earlier.

If you think about Q4, we think we'll have -- certainly we've added a lot of selection over the past 12 months, a lot of great unique selection. So we think we are well positioned for Q4 from a selection standpoint. We continue to make sure that our prices are sharp so we have great value for customers. We continue to work on improving service levels, and that comes in a number of different forms, but certainly getting goods to customers fast is important, and certainly Prime is playing a key role in that, and we have certainly a lot more Prime members this year than we had previously.

So all of those things -- we have four new Kindle products at just great prices for customers. So all those attributes set up Q4 for a nice growth quarter. All that being said, we -- giving a wide range as we have in other Q4s because, again, it's a very seasonal quarter, hard to predict, but again, we feel very, very good about the growth that we're seeing over the past quarter and our prospects for the holiday season. And that's reflected in the guidance that we're giving.

In terms of specifics on royalties and everything, we certainly wouldn't talk to that.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, R.W. Baird.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: Great. Thanks very much. Just one follow-up on the fulfillment centers, Tom. I think you mentioned before that you might need to increase beyond the 15 new centers if revenue growth were faster than originally expected, if you could confirm that that was the thought process here as well looking into Q4.

And then, just on the Kindle Fire and e-ink devices, based on your comments on sales trends thus far, is there any potential supply constraint that you foresee for the holiday period? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part, in terms of fulfillment centers, yes. As I mentioned 90 days ago, we've given a range of guidance for the topline for Q3. We hadn't given guidance for Q4. We were very excited about the growth that we were seeing through the first half of the year, but we wanted to get through Q3, and -- but -- and again, I had announced -- or I mentioned 90 days ago that we had announced that we were opening 15 and potentially one or two more, and that reality is coming true.

We are actually opening up 17, so -- and again, that illustrates how we feel about not the growth that has happened in the past -- that's certainly impacting how we are thinking about it, but it impacts -- the fulfillment we're adding is about growth going forward, and so we feel very good about the growth that we're experiencing and we'll look at a number of different factors, including our most recent historical growth rates.

In terms of supply, you probably saw the release, but again, in the first three weeks since launch, orders for our e-ink Kindles are double the previous launch. We're also seeing extremely strong Kindle Fire pre-orders, and we're increasing capacity and building millions more than we've already planned. And so, that's what we're doing from a production standpoint, and we're getting ready, as you'd expect, for just a great holiday season for customers overall and for Kindle customers.

OPERATOR: Matt Nemer, Wells Fargo.

MATT NEMER, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC: Thanks for taking my question. First, your employee count is up about 19% sequentially versus a move of about 10% over the last few years, so I'm wondering is this quarter and next quarter when you hire a lot of temporary workers the apex of the pain that you'll feel on all these new FCs, or do you think that employee growth could actually accelerate in the first half of next year?

And then, secondly, your shipping costs were also up pretty significantly. How much of that is Prime usage versus Prime customer acquisition cost? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of employment, we're not guiding or giving estimates beyond the quarter, but you're right. We're seeing a large sequential increase in employment and a large year-over-year increase in employment, and it's across many different areas that we're adding, but certainly the most notable, both from a year-over-year and sequential and certainly represents the majority of the additions, would be our operations and customer service associates, and so those are certainly growing fast, and we're also -- given the opportunities we have to grow, we're also investing in other areas.

But, again, the majority of the sequential and year-over-year increase is coming from operations and customer service associates.

In terms of the ship margin, as you were mentioning, certainly Prime is certainly having a big impact there, and so -- as well as our free shipping offers. So that's what's -- that's certainly what's driving it.

OPERATOR: Kerry Rice, Needham & Company.

KERRY RICE, ANALYST, NEEDHAM & COMPANY: Thanks a lot for fitting me in here. So, I know that you guys launched in Spain this quarter or towards the end of Q3, beginning of Q4. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the additional international strategy? Should we think of that as the first step further into Europe or maybe into Latin America?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the two most recent country launches were certainly Spain and Italy, and it's very early. It's -- we're very happy to be serving those geographies. Very excited about it and think they're very interesting long-term opportunities. We have -- we were able to take advantage of our European infrastructure and leadership team to launch those two geographies and we're very excited about it.

JOHN FELTON: Great, thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website to at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: That does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. John Felton. Please go ahead.

   TD
JOHN FELTON, DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENT RELATIONS, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect Management's views as of today, July 26, 2011, only; and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's Conference Call, we encourage you to have our Press Release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010.

Now, we'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM INC: Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 25%, to $3.21 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 8%, to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital was 21%, down from 34%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding, was 468 million shares, compared with 465 million shares.

Worldwide revenue grew 51%, to $9.91 billion, or 44%, excluding the $477 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and shipping offers. Media revenue increased to $3.66 billion, up 27%, or 20%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $5.89 billion, up 69%, or 62%, excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 59% of worldwide (inaudible), up from 53%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 56%, compared to 45% paid unit growth in Q1 2011. Active customer counts exceeded 144 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units, compared to 36% of paid units in Q1 2011, and 34% of paid units in Q2 2010.

Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. The cost of sales was $7.52 billion, or 75.9% of revenue, compared with 75.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology, and content and G&A combined, was $2 billion; or 20.2% of sales, up approximately 190 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $909 million, or 9.2% of revenue, compared with 8.5%. Tech and Content was $624 million, or 6.3% of revenue, compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $331 million, or 3.3% of revenue, compared with 3.1%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results; and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments of stock-based compensation or other operate expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 51% to $5.41 billion. Adjusting for the $3 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 50%. Media revenue grew 20% to $1.58 billion. EGM revenue grew 67% to $3.5 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues, up from 58%. North America segment operating income increased 7% to $214 million, a 4% operating margin.

In the international segment, revenue grew 51% to $4.51 billion. Adjusting for the $473 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 36%. Media revenue grew 34% to $2.07 billion, or 20%, excluding foreign exchange; and EGM revenue grew 71% to $2.4 billion, or 53%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 53% of international revenues, up from 47%. International segment operating income decreased 16% to $172 million, a 3.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 34%.

CSOI decreased 5% to $386 million, or 3.9% of revenue, down 229 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $28 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 12%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 25% to $201 million, or 2% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $49 million in Q2, resulting in a 22% rate for the quarter, and a 26% rate year-to-date. GAAP net income was $191 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared with $207 million and $0.45 per diluted share. Second quarter 2011 net income was positively impacted by equity method investment activity of $15 million, including a $49 million gain on sale of an equity position, partially offset by $34 million in losses from equity method investments.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.25 billion year-over-year, to $6.36 billion. Inventory increased 66%, to $3.23 billion, and inventory turns were 11.3, down from 12.5 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts Payable increased 61% to $5.72 billion, and Accounts Payable Days increased to 69 from 65 in the prior year. Our Q2 2011 capital expenditures were $433 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure; including Amazon Web Services, capacities to support our fulfillment operations, and investments in corporate office space.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy in consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intra-Company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates, can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q3 2011, we expect net sales to be between $10.3 and $11.1 billion, a growth in between 36% and 47%. This guidance anticipates approximately 450 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $20 million and $170 million, or between 93% decline and 37% decline. This includes approximately $180 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $200 million and $350 million, or between a 50% decline and 13% decline. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks, and with that, John, let's move to questions.

JOHN FELTON: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: Thank you.

(Operator Instructions)

Our first question today comes from Jim Friedland with Cowen & Co.

JAMES (JIM) FRIEDLAND, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Thanks, I wanted to ask a question about how you think about ROI and free cash flow as you invest really aggressively to support this [50%] growth. We are seeing free cash flow levels depressed in the near term. How long can this, do you expect this to continue if you keep grabbing share? Should we continue to expect pressure in terms of free cash flow? Just trying to get a sense of how we should think about incremental capital invested. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of how we think about these investments, our approach has been pretty consistent over the years. If you look at the, as you mentioned, the strong growth, this is the strongest growth we've had from a quarterly perspective year-over-year in over 10 years. As a result of that, as we look forward, there's a requirement for a lot of capacity, and that's something I talked about on previous calls.

If you think about our capacity, it comes in a number of different forms. First of all, our core retail business. We need both fulfillment capacity as well as infrastructure capacity. This is something that we've been doing, really since our inception. I look at it as a high-quality problem. We have a -- if you back out cash from our securities you'll see that we have a high ROIC. I'm not saying that's certainly a historical performance. It's not necessarily a predicted performance, but I do feel very good about those investments.

Those are something that we've done before, and it's something that we've been working to perfect, really since we opened our doors back in the mid-1990s. In terms of -- there's another set of investments. Certainly you're seeing we're investing in the conversion from physical to digital. We think we have good assets to do that. We're very focused on the customer experience, and that comes in a number of different forms.

We feel very good about those investments in terms of the traction that we're getting from a customer standpoint, and we're certainly optimistic about our ability to generate good free cash flow while having high returns on invested capital.

Then we have some newer businesses. I say newer, they've been with us for several years, but at least they weren't with us since inception like beyond the digital initiatives like web services. That's a business that we're investing in. We have great traction and the team has done a terrific job there, and we continue to improve that business, and it's growing very fast. You're seeing capital requirements for that business.

That's a business that the team is operating very carefully. They're looking at best ways to improve return on invested capital over time, and we think that's a great big space to be investing in and we think it's good for that customer set, and it's good for -- we hope it to be good for the customers over the long term.

JAMES (JIM) FRIEDLAND: Just quickly on the investment in AWS, it looks like the tech and content line has been accelerating and the Q-over-Q ramp was pretty meaningful again in Q2. Is the primary driver there AWS, or is it a mix of things?

TOM SZKUTAK: It's a mix of things, but certainly AWS would be a big piece of that, along with our infrastructure to support our retail business. When I say our retail business, I mean everything but AWS. So again, think of it as the infrastructure cost to support those two businesses. There certainly are other investments we're making that are in that line item, but certainly those are two big pieces.

JAMES (JIM) FRIEDLAND: Great. Thank you.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Our next question comes from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks, good afternoon. Tom, just a two-part question on media, and then a housekeeping question. On media, the revenue growth there re-accelerated pretty nicely from the last couple quarters. Is there anything you would call out there in terms of driving that re-acceleration, any sort of specific categories? And then the second part, I know it's still relatively early days for Prime Instant Video, but was wondering if you could share with us some of the metrics you've seen the impact on Prime membership. And just last on the housekeeping question. How much were acquisitions to revenue growth in 2Q and in your 3Q guidance? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of media, it was pretty broad across-the-board. Certainly, you're seeing great growth in our digital products, including Kindle that's represented there.

The other thing to call out just from a sequential standpoint as you look at international specifically, we did see -- and this is reflected in the total growth rate for international, as well as the media growth rate -- we did see an acceleration from Q1 to Q2 for our Japan business. We talked about last time being soft, given the events there. Our team there has done a terrific job serving customers, so we have seen the growth rates return more favorably from first quarter. They're not quite where they were last year, but certainly they've seen an acceleration there. So that is also impacting our global media growth rates, and it shows up in our international segment.

In terms of Prime Instant Video, we're measuring, as you'd expect, a number of different things for that business. It's very early right now. There's not a lot I can share with you. What I can say, though, is we like what we've seen so far. We are continuing to invest there and right now, we're seeing customers love it and it's early. So again, that's something that we'll continue to focus on.

Then your third question in terms of acquisitions impact. For Q2, the most recent acquisitions for Quidsi and LOVEFiLM, that impact year-over-year for those two acquisitions is approximately -- a little over 200 basis points -- approximately 220 basis points. We had a small amount in Q1, so if you're looking at it sequentially, assume it was about 30 basis points in Q1, and a little over 200 basis points in Q2. Again those are both year-over-year numbers that impact those acquisitions, as LOVEFiLM was half a quarter in Q1.

In terms of bottom-line impact or CSOI and operating income, for Q2, CSOI was negative $19 million. For GAAP operating income, it was negative $27 million -- that's for Q2. In terms of Q3, it's reflected in the guidance that we're giving today and we're not breaking out those specific numbers.

JAMES (JIM) FRIEDLAND: Great, thank you.

OPERATOR: And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney at Citi.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Tom, I want to ask about how you think through balancing margins and growth. I know you don't run the business for margins for free cash flow, but as you brought the margins down and invested aggressively to support what's this accelerating 10-year high growth rates, I assume you're doing that with a view not to just growth rate one quarter out or two quarters out, but for a full year out.

Do you feel that you've got enough grasp over the business such that when you see that growth rate slowing down, which inevitably must, whenever that is in the year that you can easily ramp up margins? Do you really feel like you're at a point in the business model where that tradeoff is a very easy thing for you to manage? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. The way you should think about it is, first of all the growth rates that you're seeing in Q2 really stem from investments that we've made over a long period of time. These aren't investments that we've made over the past few quarters. We have invested capacity over the last several quarters to help support that growth, and certainly that's one of the investments that's more recent. But again you should think about it as investments that we've made over long periods of time.

For example, we started investing in our Kindle business and AWS businesses several years ago now and those have gotten great traction. We've launched FBA several years ago. We launched Prime a few years back. We continue to launch new categories. We continue to add unique selections. So those are things that have happened over an extended period of time. We are also planting new seeds today. You see that Prime Instant Video is an example of that. Some of the -- a lot of the offerings that we have within AWS are examples of those. Again, we have many examples of those across the business.

So when we look at, similar to the answer that I gave to Jim in the first question, is again, think about our business in a number of different pieces, but we have our retail business that we've been operating in since inception. We continue to add capacity to support those. We continue to add selection and so those are parts of the business that we feel very very good about, and the fact that we have to deploy more capital in terms of capacity, we feel very good about.

Again, our historical returns aren't predictive, but we feel very good about it. Then we feel very good about the assets we have in our digital space as we convert from physical to digital. Then we talked about some of the other newer investments, as well, that we feel very good that we're investing in today that we certainly hope and plan on getting good returns for shareholders.

But our goal, ultimately is, as you mentioned, not to optimize for margins, but our goal is to maximize free cash flow and have high ROICs.

MARK MAHANEY: Thank you, Tom.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask two things. First, Tom, it looks like you hired 5,300 people during the quarter. Can you give us some color on how they're spread out across the business? Then secondly, as you look at your margin outlook here for 3Q, can you give us some color on the target roll-off, and whether that's contemplated here in the outlook, and how much of an impact that is? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the people in the quarter, keep in mind that we did acquire Quidsi at the start of the quarter, so that's included in the number. So if you take Quidsi plus the operations in CS, people that we added for the capacity that we've been talking about, the combination of those two make up the majority of those adds.

Now we still had, certainly, adds across the business, and in a number of different areas, and particularly in some of the areas that I mentioned in some of the earlier questions. Again, the majority are, of those 5,300, as well as, actually, the year-over-year increase that's just under 15,000, is due to operations in CS, and again, more recently, the acquisition of Quidsi.

In terms of the margin, again in terms of target, they've announced that they're going to be going to their new website in Q4. We've had a very good relationship with them over the past several years, and we certainly wish them well in their new -- with their new website. We are pleased to offer that service, the services for them. Again, they've announced that they'll be switching to a new website in Q4.

DOUG ANMUTH: Thanks.

OPERATOR: We'll go next to Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Thank you very much. Two quick questions, please. First on the -- can you provide us an update on the distribution build-out? How many distribution centers do you have -- or you had at by year-end -- I'm sorry, by quarter end. How many you think you're going to have by year-end. I'm trying to figure out your capacity utilization today versus, say, six months ago.

Second, can you talk about the strategy behind maybe the plant launch of the tablet products? Would you be able to leverage in-store distribution channels for that product similar to what you've done with Kindle?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of fulfillment centers, last quarter when we had our call, we had mentioned, or I'd mentioned that we had announced nine fulfillment centers globally at that point. Right now, we've announced 15, and we're actually planning on a few more than that between now and the end of the year. So again, if you look at where we're hiring for, we've announced it's 15 today, and you should expect a few more. That compares to, we added 13 last year, so it will be more than 15, 13 last year it will be more than 15 this year.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: And that's for a total of how many?

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, we haven't given a total for the year, but it's approximately in the low 50s, adding 15 on top of that, and then expect a few more.

In terms of your other question, we have a longstanding practice of not talking about what we might or might not do, and so I can't help you with that question.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Okay, thanks a lot.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi, thanks. Tom, net shipping costs were up 110 basis points year-over-year. Just wondering if you could talk about the impacts on that from oil prices versus Amazon Prime adoption and the other customer experience initiatives that you've been working on. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: If you look at really our net shipping costs over the last several quarters, what you've seen is, we've been shipping, and certainly more free, and that includes Amazon Prime. We've also certainly incurred some higher shipping costs, as you mentioned, with fuel prices. But that's something that we've been dealing with, really, since we started offering free shipping back in the early 2000s. So that's something that we're used to dealing with. It's something that we have dealt with.

Again, what you're seeing again over the last several quarters is certainly the customers like our free shipping programs and including Amazon Prime, and that's reflected in that number. That's also one of the inputs, along with a lot of the other things we've been talking about that's helping fuel our growth.

OPERATOR: We'll go next to Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first off, going back, Tom, to what you mentioned earlier in the call, and the drivers of accelerating growth, I wonder if you could talk about the relative importance of these factors, in particular the low prices.

Then secondly, just curious in the progress you're making in growing the China business. I think you've added more fulfillment capacity there. E-Commerce, in general, appears to be accelerating in that market. If you could talk about your position and the relative importance of that? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of lower prices, it's kind of hard to describe to answer your question, actually. We view it as an extremely important aspect of our business. There's a number of different things that are important to customers, and certainly making sure we have great prices for customers and great values for customers is extremely important.

It's something that we've been working on for a number of years, making sure that we know when we have great prices relative to others. So that's something that we've continued to work on, to make it a great experience for customers. We do that globally across all of our categories.

In terms of your question on China, we're very pleased with our business in China. It's growing very fast. We are in investment mode in that country. We think it's a very interesting long-term opportunity, and the team's doing a very nice job there and continues to invest and we're seeing nice growth there.

COLIN SEBASTIAN: Thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with UBS.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, UBS: Great, thanks. Tom, maybe you could give us an update on affiliates and the sales tax issue that's going on. Any updates there, as you cut ties with affiliates of the states that collect sales taxes. How should we be thinking about the impact on both revenue and margin? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: I think in terms of the sales tax issue in total, the way you should think about it is, we support a federal simplified approach, as we have for more than 10 years. We think in the US, that the federal solutions is the right way to solve this. Also keep in mind as you think about our global business, we already collect sales tax or equivalent in more than half of our business, or approximately half of our business across the world. Again, we think the right solution to the US is a federal solution.

In terms of beyond that, we continue to serve our customers globally and continue to work through the issue that you described.

BRIAN PITZ: Should we think about any additional reductions in the number of affiliates going forward, or are we at a stable point right now?

TOM SZKUTAK: I really can't comment on that. We're incredibly pleased to have our affiliates. We continue to work with them, and there's not much more I could add to that.

BRIAN PITZ: Great, thanks.

OPERATOR: We'll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Great, two questions. In general, digital content is becoming a growing industry theme, as well, as it seems like, for Amazon. I guess, curious as to whether you can comment on if there's a higher propensity for prime customers to adopt digital content, or is it broad-based among the customer base as a whole. Then second, a lot of the investments you're pushing through today in terms of facilities, OpEx, et cetera.

Can you talk about maybe what year are they typically geared for? How far out do you typically plan for in terms of investments today on products, new or existing? How far out do you typically think about from a planning standpoint that you're already absorbing in the model today? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of digital content, we certainly have an offering right now -- you asked for the relationship between that and Prime. We certainly have a product with Prime Instant Video that we like. It's extremely early, but we're learning customers love it, what they're seeing so far. We like what we're seeing so far in terms of some of the metrics, but again it's very very early.

We do think that we're fortunate that we can offer such a service to customers, along with free shipping. We think that our good customers like both -- they're both physical and digital customers, so I'm not sure there's much more I can add to that.

And then I'm sorry, the second part of your question?

JEETIL PATEL: Yes, a lot of the expense build and investments that you're making today in the form of OpEx and CapEx, how far out do you typically think through some of these plans in terms of today, and what you're assuming in the model, on these last couple quarters relative to when you start to see the fruits of the labor, some of the products start to commercialize in the marketplace?

TOM SZKUTAK: We look at our overall investments, certainly, on a long-term basis. We have -- when we launch or invest in something new, it's usually a number of years before we're cash flow positive. And then many cases, several years before we're cash flow positive. So we do take a long-term view.

That being said, we monitor those investments very carefully. For example -- and we do it on a discrete basis, on an area-by-area basis, in terms of our investment. For example, in our web services business, that team has done a very nice job of growing that business, innovating on behalf of customers. They're also trying to see how do we get and ensure we get higher ROICs on that business.

So, they've been working on that for a number of years. They will look at it on a service-by-service basis. What they're trying to do is become not only great -- have great services for customers -- but to be as efficient as possible in terms of from an investment standpoint.

So those are, that just happens to be an example that happens across the business, and we continue to monitor those investments.

JEETIL PATEL: If I ask it a different way, but the unit growth you're seeing this year of 50%-plus, when do you think you put in the investments or the plans in the P&L? Would you say it was back in 2008, or 2007, or would you say it was more recent than that?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, yes, and yes. In terms of what enabled us to have the growth rate that we're experiencing today, I'll just take the retail part of our business for a second. There are many many aspects to it but let me take just the retail part of it. We've continued to add great selection over a long period of time, and when I say great selection, unique selection.

We've continued to get sharper and sharper on our pricing, understanding exactly where we are from a pricing standpoint. We've continued to launch new programs like -- that get our product to customers quicker. We offered free shipping, and a number of years ago that made it more economical. We offer Prime to make it come quicker and more economical to get to customers. So it's a great service for customers. All of these things have built upon themselves. We offer third-party offerings, or 36% of our total units.

Several years ago now or a few years ago now we launched Fulfilled by Amazon, as we make that experience better for customers, as well as sellers. So these things have built upon each other over a period of years, and now what you're seeing is, there's a concentrated amount of investment that's going in relative to capacity, more recently.

That really came out of -- you see different periods of growth that we've had where things have gotten softer, that we will absorb that investment, and it becomes more productive. We saw that happen, particularly in the US when we had the downturn, starting in late 2008. It went through a portion, certainly, of 2009, even though our global growth was still in the high 20s. It was a little bit softer in the US for some of those periods. We were able to add less fixed investment to support the capacity for that part of the business because of the growth.

Now what you've seen is, now coming off of that through 2010, you saw very strong growth, we had 40% growth. In 2010, you saw very strong growth in Q1. We had 36% growth on a currency basis. Even with some of the softness in Japan, you've seen a re-acceleration in Q2, where growth was 44%, including a couple hundred basis points of acquisition growth, sequentially.

Again, these are building upon each other. Some of the larger investments we've made to support capacity, or more recent over the past 18 months now, and that's continuing, as you see from our Q3 guidance given the growth we're experiencing.

I'm trying to separate a little bit the growth to support the -- sorry, the capacity to support the growth. But then we've made many smaller -- some not so small -- investments over the past 10 years plus that have brought us to the growth rates -- the customer experience we have today.

JEETIL PATEL: Thanks, but strategic versus tactical spend.

TOM SZKUTAK: Correct, so tactical -- some of the investments that's required to support from a capacity standpoint in infrastructure, as well as FCs, to support a retail business for example, I would consider that tactical, or running-the-business type investment. Those have been sizeable. You can see our step change in our capital. Part of it's for that growth, for that reason. Part of it's for growth in FBA, and part of it is for growth in web services, as well as a few other areas.

OPERATOR: We'll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: Good afternoon, and congratulations and back to the tax question. It's inevitable that 100% of your business will be taxed and let's fast forward to that point. What message would you have for investors on how to think about the impact that will have on your business. Then a follow-up to that is, there's some rumors that as you pull the affiliates out of California you may actually have some sort of sales tax liability. Can you put any of those rumors to rest? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of where we'll end up, I'm certainly not going to speculate where we'll end up over a period of time in terms of sales tax and then again I'm talking the broader issue, not any particular state.

The way I think about it is, I talked about our approach in terms of the US of having a federal or national solution, and I think that's the right approach. In terms of the business itself, one thing to keep in mind is that we do collect, as a reminder, sales tax or equivalent tax in approximately half of our business today. So when you look at the growth rates that we're experiencing, again half, or a little over half of our business, we're collecting that today. So that's part of the base that we have.

In the end, what customers really want is they want a great experience. They want, certainly they want low prices. They want the selection that they're looking for. They want fast delivery. They want it to be as convenient as possible. That's true among, certainly, our retail customers, so we continue to work on that experience. We continue to work on trying to make the seller experience even better. FBA, Fulfilled by Amazon is another example of that, that happens to also have a customer benefit, the consumer not just the seller. But again, sellers like it as well as consumers.

We continue to make sure that our experience is good for our web services business. We take the customer experience extremely seriously. It's something we're working on very, very hard. And our digital offerings -- Kindle, we have a great team, who's innovating on behalf of customers across the business, including our Kindle business. So they're trying to make sure they continue to innovate.

So all of these things that I mentioned are things that we think are important for customers, and ultimately, why customers will purchase from us or not. Those are the things we're going to continue to work on, because we can't predict what will happen in some of these other things, but we can predict that customers will still want low prices, they'll still want great selection, they'll still want convenience, they'll still want innovative products and services on their behalf. So those are the things that we're going to be continuing to work on and have worked on since our inception.

GENE MUNSTER: And then the affiliates. Is there any sales tax, are you guys liable for any past sales tax in California?

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, I can't -- I'm not going to comment on that.

GENE MUNSTER: Okay, thank you.

OPERATOR: Our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you. Two things. Talked about a lot of things but not AWS. I guess, how's the trajectory? Do you think it still can be as big as retail? Any thoughts on what the margin profile of that business looks like relative to your core? So just thoughts on AWS in general.

Then secondly, did you change the historical third-party unit forecast? I had a couple questions on that. It looks like some of the historicals might have been higher than what you might have said in a couple prior quarters, thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: I'll answer the second one first. In terms of the units, growth in the third party units. What we did this quarter, which was different than we have previously is that we actually went with a paid units growth, as opposed to a total units. Historically, we've been including, there's been some amount of free units included in those numbers.

For example, if you take a look at our current quarter, the number I mentioned was paid unit growth of 56%. That compared to -- again that's paid unit growth -- that compared to 45% paid unit growth in Q1. The number that we reported in Q1 was actually 51% because that included free. So the comparable, the 45% for Q1 and the 56% for Q2 are comparable. Again those are just paid units. Then the third-party percentage of total units was 36% this quarter, up from 34% last year. Again, those are paid units versus a percentage of total units.

So we thought it would be another interesting way of looking at it, so we thought we would provide it this quarter.

In terms of the AWS business, it's certainly a very very big space. Hard to say how big it will be for Amazon, but we're incredibly excited about that business. The team has done a terrific job and continues to innovate on behalf of customers. We have just a great team of innovators and operators running that business, and we're very excited about it.

JUSTIN POST: Can you say whether it's in investment mode, or is it contributing at all to the bottom line at this point?

TOM SZKUTAK: You should expect that we continue to invest in that business because of the high-growth nature of it. It's growing very fast. It is one of the reasons why you're seeing, certainly, a big contributor to our CapEx. It's also reflected in the tech and content line. Again, we're very excited about what we're seeing there. The team is going to continue to stay heads-down focused on their customer to drive that business.

JUSTIN POST: Thank you.

JOHN FELTON: Great, well thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. The replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day and welcome to the Amazon quarterly conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. John Felton, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

   TD
JOHN FELTON, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2011 financial results conference call. Joining us today are Tom Szkutak, our CFO, and Rob Eldridge, our VP of Investor Relations. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2011 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2010.

Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, John. I'll begin with comments on our first- quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 9% to $3.03 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 18% to $1.9 billion. Return on invested capital of 24% down from 45%; ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.

The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 466 million shares compared with 463 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 38% to $9.86 billion or 36%, excluding the $144 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers, who also continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and shipping offers.

Media revenue increased to $3.96 billion, up 15%, or 13% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $5.59 billion, up 59%, or 57% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 49%. Worldwide unit growth was 51%. Active customer accounts exceeded 137 million. Worldwide active seller account were more than 2 million. Seller units were 33% of total units.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $7.61 billion or 77.2% of revenue compared with 77.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $1.78 billion or 18.1% of sales, up 234 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $831 million or 8.4% of revenue compared with 7.4%. Technical content was $518 million, or 5.3% of revenue compared with 4.5%. Marketing was $320 million or 3.2% of revenue compared with 2.7%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation, or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $5.47 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.89 billion; EGM revenue grew 63% to $3.3 billion, representing 60% of North America revenues, up from 54%. North America segment operating income increased 6% to $290 million, a 5.3% operating margin.

In the international segment, revenue grew 31% to $4.39 billion. Adjusting for the $141 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%. We estimate that the international revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points following the earthquake and subsequent events in Japan.

Media revenue grew 13% to $2.07 billion or 9%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.29 billion or 49%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 52% of international revenues, up from 44%. International segment operating income decreased 25% to $175 million, a 4.0% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 28%.

CSOI decreased 8% to $465 million or 4.7% of revenue, down 239 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $7 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 9%.

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 18% to $322 million or 3.3% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $89 million in Q1 or a 29% rate for the quarter. The tax provision for Q1 2011 includes income tax expense of approximately $8 million related to a discreet item in the quarter. GAAP net income was $201 million, or $0.44 per diluted share compared with $299 million and $0.66 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.82 billion year-over-year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 59% to $2.89 billion, and inventory turns were 11.6, down from 12.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts Payable increased 53% to $5.54 billion and Accounts Payable days increased to 66 from 59 in the prior year.

Our Q1 2011 capital expenditures were $298 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling into Company balances and foreign currencies among subsidiaries; unfavorable resolution of legal matters; and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments; record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates; and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q2 2011, we expect net sales of between $8.85 billion and $9.65 billion or growth between 35% and 47%. This guidance anticipates approximately 640 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange.

GAAP operating income to be between $95 million and $245 million or between 65% decline and 9% decline. This includes approximately $180 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $275 million and $425 million, or between a 32% decline and 5% growth.

We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks. With that, John, let's move to questions.

JOHN FELTON: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions). Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks for taking the question. Two quick questions for Tom. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on your 2Q guidance and what you're thinking the impact from Japan could be? And how you're thinking about when you incorporate that into your guidance?

And then, secondly, on shipping, the losses seem like they're growing. So I was wondering if you could just talk, Tom, about, is that a function of more prime usage, faster shipping or fuel costs perhaps impacting that line? Any more detail there would be great. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of your first question, what we saw for Japan -- first of all, I'll talk just briefly about Q1 and then I'll talk about Q2.

Q1, in terms of impact, we think the impact is approximately 500 basis points on international revenue; because if you take a look at international revenue growth, excluding foreign exchange, it was up 27%. So but for the unfortunate events in Japan, it would have been approximately 32%. The impact on Q1 in terms of consolidated segment operating income is approximately $20 million.

What we saw post the events, we certainly saw a pretty sizable slowdown for the few weeks ending the quarter. What we've seen since then so far quarter-to-date has been that, certainly, our growth rates have picked up, but they're not at the rates they were previous to the events. So, again, we're seeing positive growth there but not the growth rates we were seeing prior to that. And so what we believe for the quarter, along with all of our other assumptions, are included in the guidance that we've given today.

In terms of your second question related to shipping profit, what you're really seeing there is customers are coming out in great numbers with all of our -- adopting all of our free shipping programs, including Amazon Prime. And you're, of course, seeing great adoption there and that's really what's driving those numbers.

OPERATOR: And ladies and gentlemen, we also ask that you please limit yourself to your question, so that everyone will have a chance to ask a question today. You may return to the queue for follow-up questions. We'll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Great, thanks. A couple of questions. One, I guess when you look at your -- it looks like the international business is really starting to kick in nicely, and it seems like Amazon Prime has now had a chance to really mature and ramp up in a lot of your regions. I'm curious, are you seeing the same type of returns that you saw in the US market, in terms of customer adoption, purchase frequency in the international markets around Prime?

And second, it seems like Kindle, you're kind of employing a same -- similar strategy that you did with Prime, which is stagger versus the US market. And is it almost following the same path of ramp and returns for the Kindle initiatives globally, as you saw in the US market?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of your first question, Jeetil, related to Prime, we are seeing these similar dynamics. We are seeing customers love Prime in all geographies that we've offered it in. We are seeing great cross-shopping of this happening, so customers really like the program. And obviously, we have different offers depending upon geography, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far.

In terms of Kindle, we've seen tremendous growth, both from a device standpoint as well as unit standpoint, in terms of digital books in the US. And where we're now offering it outside of the US, we're seeing the same; even though it's very early, we're seeing great adoption and growth there. So we're very, very happy to see the progress that we've made.

One thing that we're doing -- obviously, you probably saw the launch related to -- the announcement related to Kindle's special offers, we actually will start shipping tomorrow. The team did a nice job of moving the dates up from several days from now to start shipping tomorrow. So very pleased to be able to offer that and excited about that offering.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citi.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thanks. Two quick questions. That 51% unit growth seems like a real outlier. You haven't had that kind of unit growth in the past. Is there something in there that's unusual? Something in there that's one time-ish? Something in there that tells -- would have you warn people to think that that's not a sustainable growth level?

And then very recently you had something of an outage in Amazon Web Services field. Was that a demand problem, which is not necessarily a bad thing? Or are there certain efficiencies that you needed to -- or inefficiencies that you needed to address that have been fixed? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Probably the best way to answer the unit growth rate is if you take a look at what we saw in Q4, which is 43% growth rate. We saw nice acceleration from 43% to 51% in Q1. What you're seeing there is we saw great growth across the business, but the biggest thing you're seeing is that, which is primarily the consequence of growth of our digital business -- that's what you're seeing in the growth rate, the acceleration in growth rate down from Q4 to Q1.

In terms of AWF, again, the team is working very deliberately on the way to identify and validate and fix the root causes associated with this incident. And that's what they're working on. And I don't really have a lot to add to that at this time.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Jefferies.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, the midpoint of guidance for Q2 implies margins about 1.8%. So x-SBC, where's the other 150 bps or so of additional spend going? How much of that is on recurring things like the 4,200 people or so you hired in the quarter versus any one-time items?

And second, on the state tax issue, how big is it a -- or big a concern is it to you, how big an advantage do you believe you've enjoyed so far from not paying taxes in those states? I guess, in other words, would you have been able to grow at the rates you have been growing that, if taxes were levied across -- on your business across the US? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of your first question, we're not breaking out the individual line items, if you will, for operating expenses, but if you take a look at what we saw in Q1, you're seeing that we've added a lot of capacity. You see that in our CapEx and you also see the fulfillment capacity; you see it in our CapEx and you also see it in the fulfillment line item. We added 13 fulfillment centers last year.

If you take a look at the announcements that we've had to date, we're adding nine fulfillment centers this year. Those are the ones that we've announced. With the growth rates we're seeing, you should expect, if it were to continue, you should see more than that this year as well -- more than the nine. So that's what you're seeing in the Q1. And you're also seeing that reflected in the Q2 guidance as well.

The same is true with technical content. We're adding a lot of capacity this quarter, or growing business. Again, you've seen that reflected in the CapEx as well as the Q1 technical content line. And that's also reflected in the guidance as well.

In terms of state taxes, one thing to keep in mind is we actually collect sales and value-added tax in approximately 50% of our revenue base or a little over 50% of our revenue base today. So the growth rates that you're seeing reflect the fact that we are collecting in more than half of our revenue base. So beyond that, there's not a lot I can add there.

OPERATOR: James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much for taking the question. If I look at the 74% growth in North America and other revenues, is that primarily due to Amazon Web Services?

And then similarly, if I look at the step-up in CapEx, would that also be primarily due to Amazon Web Services? And then kind of uniting those two questions together, historically, Amazon has been very capital-disciplined. How do you get confidence that the capital you're putting into Amazon Web Services will generate returns over times that you desire?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. If you look at North America other growth, that -- in the North America other includes a number of items including Web services, so it's a combination of all those items that we've talked about in the past. And so -- but certainly Web services is a meaningful part of that.

In terms of the CapEx question, what you're seeing in CapEx is, if you look at the growth, we had $1.1 billion of CapEx and -- in the last 12 months. And if you look at the growth year-over-year of that CapEx, approximately 80% of that is due to pure capacity and that's capacity in terms of fulfillment; it's capacity from an infrastructure standpoint to serve retail business as well as AWS. And another 10% or 12% is associated with just corporate office space, and the remainder is a number of small items. So, again, the vast majority, approximately 80%, is due to capacity, both infrastructure and our operations capacity.

In terms of your question about how we think about AWS, we -- like a lot of parts of our business, we look at that business very discreetly and those services very discreetly. And we look at the ROIC potential of those businesses and the opportunity to work on trying to figure out the best way to get great returns for shareholders. And that's something that we've been doing since we launched the business. And obviously, we have a lot more information to do that now than we did at launch. But again, it's something that we do continuously.

OPERATOR: Jim Friedland, Cowen and Company.

JIM FRIEDLAND, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: One of the other line items that was up year-over-year was marketing expense, 50 basis points. Is that a ramp or an incremental ramp in Kindle promotion? You guys also did something with a LivingSocial promotion in Q1. And also equity and affiliates was up a little bit. Was that due to the LivingSocial investment? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of marketing, the two primary paid marketing are still our Associates channel and Sponsored Search. And so those are our two primary. But you're correct in terms of we are doing, as you've probably seen, some more broadscale advertising related to Kindle, which would be certainly incremental year-over-year and certainly impacting that number.

In terms of the equity line, we do have a number of equity investments. And certainly, one of those is LivingSocial and it's certainly impacting that number that you're seeing.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Macquarie.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Can you discuss how Amazon views its advertising business? In particular, how ramping up capabilities there could impact both Amazon properties and devices?

And then separately, how you participate in advertising opportunities on third-party sites? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of our advertising business, it's still very early. The team has done a fantastic job growing that business, and we'll have to wait and see what we do further with that business. But it's something that the team has done a great job. And it allows us -- and we think it allows over time to have another way to have great low prices for customers.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, Lazard Capital Markets.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, LAZARD CAPITAL MARKETS: -- capacity buildouts. So, when you mentioned at these topline growth rates that you might consider increasing the capital commitment to new capacity, is that something that's already reflected in the Q2 guidance range? Or is that more likely a decision for the second half of the year?

And then on the international operating income being down 25%, given that the majority of tech and content spending is incurred in North America, if you could just clarify the drivers of that decline in income. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: You just -- I'm sorry, Colin, you're just breaking up in the first part of your question around capacity.

COLIN SEBASTIAN: Sure. So you mentioned the topline growth. If these rates continue, you might consider increasing the capital commitment to new capacity. And so I guess the question is, is that already somewhat reflected in your Q2 guidance? Or would that be a second half decision in terms of ramping up beyond the nine fulfillment centers?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Well, here's where we are. We've had announcements of nine fulfillment centers. One is operational today, one is coming up, will be operational in the coming days. We're actually doing receiving now. And then the remainder of those fulfillment centers will be throughout the year.

And my comment was those are the ones that we've announced, but certainly, with the high growth that we're experiencing, you should expect that should that continue, we would be adding additional fulfillment centers beyond it. What you are seeing in the Q2 guidance certainly reflects the fact that we will be adding capacity. And that's certainly one of the factors that went into the guidance that we've given.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Just one question, please. In categories that are facing structural change in distribution like the book industry, which continues to be your largest segment, I was just wondering if you could talk about the effects that is having today or may have on the margin profile of that business for you over time? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, you know, as we look at these new businesses, we're certainly looking at it from a free cash flow and return on investment standpoint from a long-term -- with a long-term perspective. We're incredibly excited in the specific one that you mentioned with Kindle, because we see that customers are buying a lot more books. And so we're incredibly excited to be able to offer that to customers. We think the potential long-term is -- we love the potential that it has long-term. And we continue to invest in that business.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, UBS.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, UBS: A couple of quick ones. For Q2 revenue guidance, would you comment on whether Quidsi and LOVEFiLM are included? If so, any approximation of the impact?

And then on content, can you give us any indication on the level of spending to secure digital content rights you anticipate for Prime instant video? And then any commentary on whether or not that's driving Prime usage. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Quidsi and LOVEFiLM, yes, they're both in Q2. The impact is on revenue approximately $140 million of revenue in Q2, which works out to be about 220 basis points of growth. Consolidated segment operating income is actually negative -- approximately $15 million in GAAP operating income is approximately negative $30 million in the quarter. So that's what's included in the Q2 guidance for Quidsi and LOVEFiLM combined.

In terms of content, you'll have to stay tuned on that. We're not splitting out those details, but the only thing I would say about it is we're very, very pleased with the adoption so far. And it's very early. We will be adding some more content over time.

OPERATOR: Sandeep Aggarwal, Caris & Company.

SANDEEP AGGARWAL, ANALYST, CARIS & COMPANY: Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. One is -- Tom, fulfillment and shipping experience have been among the core of (inaudible) Amazon. And many multi-channel retailers and pure play commerce companies are getting into that space, or getting better at least, including eBay's possible acquisition of GSI Commerce. So how does Amazon continue to strengthen its competitive modes around fulfillment and shipping experience?

And second question is, can you make a comment about the capacity utilization of the 13 fulfillment centers you set up last year?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the first part, we have a fantastic operations team that is continuing to look at ways to improve delivery speed as well as improving our cost structure over time. And that's something that you've seen if you look back over our history, it's something that they've worked on. And so they're always looking at ways to better serve customer and to get better. And so there's a number of ways that they do that and it's a constant focus.

In terms of the capacity, I don't think there's anything -- any way to really help you, because again, the utilization will vary from week to week and quarter to quarter. But what we are seeing is, as you'd expect with this great growth that we're experiencing, there is just more demand for capacity. And that's both from a fulfillment capacity -- that's both from our core retail business as well as fulfilled by Amazon.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Ken Sena, Evercore Partners.

KEN SENA, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS: So, for the days payable to vendors, the increase was 11% to 66 days. How much more improvement do you think that you have there? Or is there something also driving that improvement that you can share? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: We're not giving -- we have been able to get good improvements over the past several years in AP days. We're not giving guidance on what that could look like and we continue -- but we continue to work with our partners to improve our working capital cycle. And obviously, there is certainly a mix of categories that we have. They all have their own operating cycle. But, again, we're very pleased with the operating cycle that we have and we'll continue to work with our partners over time.

OPERATOR: Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer & Co.

JASON HELFSTEIN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER & CO.: Can you just go into a little bit more detail on the DC centers? So, of the nine centers that you've announced, how many are international? Then are the costs higher to launch an international DC internationally than in the US? So just a little more color on that. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Of the nine -- and we could probably have Rob or John get back to you on the exact details -- but approximately four of those are in the US or five in North America, and the others are international. So -- but the fulfillment centers vary, depend upon level of automation and the location they're in. I can't really give you a precise "is geography higher than another?"; it kind of depends on size and the level of automation.

ROB ELDRIDGE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Jason, it's Rob. I think one thing to add here is Tom's point. We're expanding fulfillment capacity worldwide; it's not just in a specific geography, because the growth we're seeing is broad-based.

The second point I guess I just want to make is, as we are building to this level of scale, fulfillment becomes more of a continuous investment project. It becomes less project-oriented and just something that we need to undertake kind of on a go-forward basis. And so you're certainly seeing that decision being reflected in our Q1 results and it's also reflected in our Q2 guidance.

OPERATOR: Gene Munster, Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: I realize you guys talked about the impact of the LivingSocial promo. And as we look at the uptick in marketing expenses, it seems that you're spending a little bit more to get each incremental new customer. Is that true? And if so, what would be driving that?

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm sorry, I didn't catch the first part of it, the LivingSocial piece.

GENE MUNSTER: I know you mentioned the LivingSocial, the impact of the LivingSocial promo on the marketing expenses. But backing that out, as you look at your marketing expenses, can you just talk a little bit about customer acquisition costs and how they've been trending?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of -- I didn't mention anything about LivingSocial as it related to our marketing expense line. What I was referring to is, if you look at our equity income line on our income statement, you can see in expense there. And I said that that was made up of a number of different investments that we have, which includes LivingSocial. So that was the LivingSocial piece.

In terms of marketing spend, we still -- the spend is very efficient. And again, what I mentioned earlier was that still the two primary pieces of our spend are our Associates channel and also Sponsored Search. And so those are our two primary. In terms of looking at it year-over-year, you're also seeing some of the broadscale spending we're doing, specifically related to Kindle on impacting that number as well.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Canaccord.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CANACCORD GENUITY: Seeing growth rates accelerate even slightly for the first time in the past four quarters, to what extent would you attribute that to the infrastructure buildout, improving product selection and availability? And maybe to get a little more granular -- can you quantify for us the improvement in your product delivery time or availability that you've seen since beginning this investment cycle?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of quantifying, I'm not sure how much I can help you with that, but there's no question that what we're seeing is customers responding to the increased selection across many categories, across many geographies. We're also -- certainly, Prime is having an impact as well as our other free shipping offers. And so the adoption of both has been great. And so we're very pleased to do that.

Also, making sure that we have great, low prices for customers is also having an impact. All of those things with -- are having an impact on our growth rate that you see there.

OPERATOR: Steve Weinstein, Pacific Crest.

STEVE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES: Thanks for taking my question. So, I sort of have noticed that the growth in units relative to growth in revenue is a pretty substantial difference and kind of a widening difference. I was wondering if you could explain -- when a customer becomes a digital customer and they start buying, whether it Kindle books or another digital product, how does their spending on Amazon change? Are they spending similar amounts with you and just buying more units? Or is the actual amount of spending with Amazon going up? Because obviously, the unit growth is a lot. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: I apologize, Steve, but there's not a lot I'll be able to help you with there in terms of specific numbers. But we are seeing customers who are digital customers still being very good physical customers as well. So buying -- doing a lot of cross-shopping across our business.

And so we're very excited about our digital offerings and it's certainly reflected in the unit growth that you mentioned. But also we're seeing very good growth amongst many physical categories across all of our geographies as well. So, again, customers are responding to some of the things I already mentioned, but they're certainly responding to the selection that we have for our digital offerings as well as our physical product offerings. And that's reflected in the growth rate.

OPERATOR: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question tonight. It does come from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.

MATT NEMER, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES: Thanks for taking my question -- two questions, actually. One, is there a point where increased digital offering sales offset investments in selection and in-stocks, and we start to see that in the inventory turns number?

And then, secondly, a question on fulfillment and tax issues. How flexible is your fulfillment capacity in the US if a state changes its mind or reneges on a prior agreement regarding tax collection? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of your first question, the reason why we're adding the physical capacity is it's growing very fast. So we are having the benefit of seeing both a very strong growth in our digital offerings as well as a very strong growth in our physical offering. So it's the combination of those things that are driving the overall growth of our business as well as the fulfillment centers that you're seeing, in the case of your question.

In terms of the fulfillment centers, we have a lot of -- we have a wide range of fulfillment centers across a number of different states and geographies. And we continue -- our operations team does a great job in terms of figuring out where the best places are to invest. And they'll continue to do that over time.

JOHN FELTON: Great. Thank you very much for your questions. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation.

OPERATOR: Good day and welcome to the Amazon quarterly conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rob Eldridge.

ROB ELDRIDGE, VP IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

   TD
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 27, 2011 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures to comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009.

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Rob. I will begin with comments on our fourth-quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 6% to $3.5 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow decreased 14% to $2.52 billion. Return on invested capital was 34%, down from 66%.

ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by average sold assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter end.

The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 461 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 36% to $12.95 billion or 37%, excluding the $139 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.

We are grateful to our customers, who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.

Media revenue increased to $5.23 billion, up 12%, or 13% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $7.39 billion, up 60%, or 62% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 48%.

Worldwide unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 130 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 30% of total units.

Consolidated gross profit grew 33% to $2.63 billion, and gross margin was 20.3%.

Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.01 billion or 15.5% of sales, up 101 basis points year-over-year.

Fulfillment was $1.06 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 7.7%. Tech and content was $456 million or 3.5% of revenue compared with 3.1%. Marketing was $368 million or 2.8% of revenue, consistent with prior year.

Now we will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items.

In the North America segment revenue grew 45% to $7.21 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.37 billion. EGM revenue grew 71% to $4.56 billion, representing 63% of North America revenues, up from 54%.

North America segment operating income increased 6% to $295 million, a 4.1% operating margin.

In the international segment revenue grew 26% to $5.74 billion. Revenue growth was 29%, adjusting for the $143 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter.

Media revenue grew 11% to $2.87 billion or 13% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 46% to $2.83 billion or 50% excluding foreign exchange.

EGM now represents 49% of international revenues, up from 43%.

International segment operating income increased 3% to $327 million, a 5.7% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 16%.

CSOI grew 4% to $622 million or 4.8% of revenue, down 146 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $18 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI grew 7%.

Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was relatively flat at $474 million or 3.7% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $84 million in Q4 or 17% rate for the quarter.

GAAP net income was $416 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared with $384 million and $0.85 per diluted share.

Now I will discuss full-year results. Revenue grew 40% to $34.2 billion. North America revenue grew 45% to $18.71 billion, and international grew 33% to $15.5 billion, 34% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.

Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, grew 23% to $1.94 billion or 25% excluding $28 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin decreased 75 basis points to 5.7%.

GAAP operating income grew 25% to $1.41 billion or 4.1% of net sales.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $8.76 billion. Inventory increased 48% to $3.2 billion. And inventory turns were 11.4, down from 12.2 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.

Accounts Payable increased 44% to $8.05 billion, and Accounts Payable days increased to 72 from 68 in the prior year.

Our Q4 2010 capital expenditures were $328 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support fulfillment operations, and investments in corporate office space.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we see to date, and what we believe today to be properly conservative assumptions.

Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy, consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we have described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.

Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q1 2011 we expect net sales of between $9.1 billion and $9.9 billion, a growth of between 28% to 39%. This guidance anticipate approximately 140 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.

GAAP operating income to be between $260 million and $385 million or between 34% decline and 2% decline. This includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between $400 million and $525 million or between 21% decline and 4% growth.

We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks. With that, Rob, let's move to questions.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on with the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). So that everyone may have the opportunity to ask their question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Mark Mahaney, Citi.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITI: Two questions. First, on the gross margin trends, down a little bit year-over-year. Would that have been impacted by the strong sale of Kindle devices in the fourth quarter?

And secondly, could you just talk broadly about the Subscribe and Save offering that you have, and to what extent you have seen cross-selling into more consumer staple items amongst your customer base? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. And in terms of gross margins, you are seeing some volatility. If you look at the individual quarters from 2010, you saw that we were down a bit in Q1, up the next two quarters slightly. And then down a little bit in Q4 about approximately 45 basis points.

We haven't been talking much about gross margins because we don't think it is that meaningful. And that is why we are trying to point people to the bottom again. The reason we are doing that is because of the mix of business.

So what you're seeing there in some gross margins in Q4 is -- we have a very broad mix of businesses and geographies that are going into that number, and again, you're seeing some volatility in the individual quarters.

But, again, we are very pleased with what we saw in Q4 in terms of growth in overall performance of the business. And it reflects a very heavy investment load to support the growth that we expect.

In terms of Subscribe and Save, could you repeat the question again, sorry?

MARK MAHANEY: What kind of impact have you seen -- what kind of adoption rate have you seen for that? And just broadly your penetration of consumer staples, spending amongst the Amazon customer base. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, Subscribe and Save is going very well. It is something that certainly our customers like a lot. We are getting that benefit in the consumer portion of the consumer category today. Again, it is something that we are excited about and customers are excited about. So we are happy to offer it to them.

OPERATOR: James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you for taking my questions. If I could ask just two questions about revenue growth. And I don't want to sound critical of revenue growth, because the absolute growth rates are very high. But just digging into two components, first of all, is there any big obvious reason why international growth decelerated while domestic growth accelerated?

Then, secondly, in the media business, if e-book sales are now bigger than paperback sales, and paperback sales continue to grow, is there a big obvious reason why total media sales are growing at 13% rather than a slightly faster number?

I assume that the agency account e-books is part of that perhaps?

TOM SZKUTAK: Okay, in terms of -- you're absolutely right -- in terms of overall growth we are very pleased with what we saw. Just to kind of frame up that discussion a bit, we saw 40% growth year-over-year, total year 2010, which is the best growth rate we have seen since 2000.

We saw Q4 growth rates overall of 37% on a local currency basis, which is -- matches our best growth rate for any Q4 we have had on a local currency basis since 2000.

Then unit growth was 43%, which certainly going back several years we haven't seen a quarter -- any quarter that has had that growth. So we're seeing very strong growth across many categories, across many geographies.

In terms of the international growth specifically, if you look back to last year we did have very strong media growth in international in Q4. You will see that it is up 26% on a local currency basis, which is one of the strongest quarters we have had, and we are overlapping that. There were some new releases that were in Q4 last year, most notably the Windows 7 release, one; Dan Brown's book in Germany is another. Those are a few examples. But there are a few in the releases that were in there.

The other piece too that we haven't -- it is certainly difficult to quantify, but there was certainly some impact from some of the weather that we saw in Europe during the month of December. But, again, we are very pleased with the growth that we saw in Q4 in total, including international. And we are happy with what we see there.

In terms of some of your questions surrounding media, again, we are seeing good growth there. As you mentioned, we are seeing so far quarter date this quarter we saw that Kindle books exceeded paperbacks, which is very exciting, and while having paperbacks continue to grow year-over-year. So, again, we are seeing very strong growth there. So, again, very pleased with the growth we are seeing across the business.

JAMES MITCHELL: Is there a track on the media growth from the accounting for the agency e-books?

TOM SZKUTAK: Could you say that again?

JAMES MITCHELL: Is the fact that some of the e-books are being sold on an agency rather than a consignment basis this year acting as a drag on growth temporarily in terms of your reported revenue?

TOM SZKUTAK: Certainly, the agency piece is included in the numbers that we have reported today, but in terms of the impact, we are not breaking that out. But, again, we are very excited with the growth that we are seeing within books, e-books specifically, and physical books are going well as well.

JAMES MITCHELL: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks for taking the question. I guess two quick ones. First, Tom, for the first-quarter guidance it would seem like your operating income guidance implies that you are still reinvesting in the business. Could you just give us a little bit more color on is it still fulfillment centers, is it tech and content, all the above?

Secondly, with the LOVEFiLM's acquisition, can you just walk us through the rationale and how you will integrate that with perhaps your other video on demand businesses? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the guidance, let me just put that in context. Now probably the best way to do it is just, again, a reminder on 2010, the fact that we had very strong growth, the best growth we have seen in 10 years. Fourth-quarter matched the best -- on a local currency basis growth matched the best fourth quarter we have had since 2000. And again, very strong unit growth, the best we have seen.

With all that growth, we had to add a lot of capacity, most of which was in the second half of last year. We added fulfillment capacity this quarter, retail business. We added fulfillment capacity this quarter, growing Fulfillment by Amazon business as part of our seller business. We added a lot of infrastructure capacity this quarter -- fast-growing AWS business as well as our retail business.

So when you -- those are reflected -- when you look at our Q4 results and our 2010 results those are reflected in the CapEx numbers that you're seeing. And those are reflected in the fulfillment, as well as the tech and content lines when you look at our operating expense line items. So because it was largely back half of the year loaded, you are seeing more of that in Q1.

So that are reflected in the growth rate. Now the question will be -- we are not giving guidance beyond Q1, but what will this mean going forward?

So one of the things that we are doing is certainly when you look at our Q1 guidance, you look at our topline guidance, we're cautiously optimistic about Q1 with very strong growth. And we will have to see how much we invest throughout the year in 2011 based on that.

But, again, I am very, very happy with the capital we are able to deploy. You should keep in mind that with the sheer amount of capacity that we added in 2010 it doesn't become -- it is not fully utilized day one, and it is not -- we don't get the optimum productivity on day one. So what that means is we get productivity on those operations. We get returns on those assets that we deploy over a period of time.

But if you look at our history, we've gotten very good returns on that capital. So to me I'm very pleased to put that capital in place. And if we have to add more in 2011 it will be a high-quality problem.

SPENCER WANG: And on LOVEFiLM?

TOM SZKUTAK: LOVEFiLM, we think it is just a very exciting opportunity. We have had a close association with that business for some time. We are very pleased to be able to offer customers in the video space within Europe their offering. So, again, we are very excited about it, and you will have to stay tuned on that one.

SPENCER WANG: Thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth, Barclays Capital.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thanks for taking the question. A few things. First, I just wanted to ask in terms of the revenue growth that you are expecting for 1Q, can you give us a sense of how much you are anticipating from acquisitions?

Then, secondly, if you could comment just on your thinking around the Living Social investment? And also what you may have learned from the recent daily offer which you ran within the last week or so? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the guidance for Q1, specifically, in terms of acquisitions, LOVEFiLM or Quidsi, which haven't closed yet, are not reflected in guidance. So those are not in our Q1 numbers.

In terms of Living Social, we are very pleased with the investment that we have made there. In terms of any commentary on their recent deal, the recent one-day offer that they had, we are very excited that they offered Amazon gift certificates. And we think it is great for customers and we are happy to enable that.

DOUG ANMUTH: Thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, UBS.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, UBS: Two questions. First, an update on AWS. It looks like Other revenue in North America slowed pretty significantly. And I realize that is a decent part of Other. Any commentary on what was the main driver of that slower growth?

Second, on grocery, can you give us a little more insight on your initiatives there and the potential cost impact from expanding those categories? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, in terms of AWS, we are extremely pleased with how AWS is going. It is growing at a very fast rate. We are investing in that business to support that growth rate.

You're correct in terms of seeing the North America Other growth rate drop from 52% to 45% year-over-year from Q3 to Q4. Keep in mind that there is a number of things in there, including AWS, that tend to be a little lumpy. But we did see actually an acceleration of growth in AWS from Q3 to Q4.

So built into that number it actually accelerated. So, again, we are very pleased with the growth that we are seeing there.

In terms of grocery, we have two things that you probably could be referring to. One is our dry goods business, which is what is in our consumer business that we are very pleased with that we have on Amazon.com as well as some other sites.

In addition to that, we have a local test here in Seattle called Amazon Fresh. Again, that is a test that we have been conducting. We are pleased with how the test is going, but again, it is a test and we will continue to see how that goes and see if we invest further on that test.

Again, we do a number of tests in different parts of our business, and that happens to be one of them. We have a great team that is working on it, but you will have to stay tuned to see if we do more there.

BRIAN PITZ: Great, thanks.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Jefferies.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES: Thank you very much. Two quick questions. One, Tom, can you tell us how many distribution centers you actually had at the end of 2010? I know you're not going to guide to 2011, since you are guiding to Q1, are you planning on opening any distribution centers? And what is your CapEx for Q1?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, in terms of -- we had approximately -- approximately 52 at the end of 2010. We added 13 last year. We will add more fulfillment centers this year. We haven't said -- we are not saying how many yet, because again we are trying to determine what the growth rate will be. And based on what we have seen Q1 we are certainly cautiously optimistic, which is reflected in the growth rate you see for guidance for Q1.

So we will have to wait and see, and we will be back with you as we go throughout the year. But just to be clear, again, I mentioned in one of the other questions, I think, it would be a very high-quality problem. The reason why I say that is what our teams are doing around the world right now, which is the same thing we have been doing for the last 15 or 16 years in working with our various fulfillment centers, is even though we are not fully utilized in some of these new assets that we deployed in 2010, or our productivity is not optimum, that team is working -- will work to utilize those assets as we continue to grow.

We will get better and better productivity as we go, just like we have in our other fulfillment centers around the world that we have had experience with. So we are very excited about that.

So when will you think about the fulfillment centers, even though they can be a little bit dilutive in the short term by looking at our fulfillment expense, the reason why I'm very excited about it is you can just look at our return on invested capital. If you take our return -- our invested capital at the end of 2010, we had approximately $7.4 billion of invested capital. That is a 5 point average over the last five quarters.

If you take out cash and marketable securities over those same periods that is about $6.5 billion. So we have about $900 million of invested capital, and even with our heavier spend in CapEx last year, we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow. So we have in excess of 250% return on our invested capital ex cash from marketable securities.

So again, that is a full business. It includes a lot of things over a period of time. But if you think about that capacity, where we need it because of growth, we are certainly very happy. We do it judiciously and make sure we do it appropriately, but we are very happy to deploy that capital to get great returns for shareholders over time.

Again, the returns that we have gotten are certainly historical and not predictive, but again, we are very happy to deploy that capital, and I feel very good about it.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Are you quantifying CapEx for Q1 or no?

TOM SZKUTAK: No, we haven't quantified the CapEx for Q1, I apologize. But, again, we will do what we need to do to support the growth in both infrastructure and fulfillment.

YOUSSEF SQUALI: Thanks.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, Lazard Capital Markets.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, LAZARD CAPITAL MARKETS: One follow-up on the gross margins. I think historically Amazon's pricing philosophy has been to to be a price follower. I guess I'm curious if perhaps you are loosening that strategy up a bit, maybe to be a price leader in more categories? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of pricing, we have had a number of different strategies over the course of our history. But certainly our objective is to have great values for customers over all of our selection, over all of our geographies. And that hasn't changed.

So we are very excited to offer customers that. It is the reason -- certainly one of the drivers for the growth that we have been able to have over our history. And so, one of the things that we do do is when we enter a new category and add selection within that category we price it day one as competitively as we can.

So, in other words, we price it competitively day one based on the intelligence we have. And sometimes that means that it is very low gross margin, because we are just entering those particular categories with those particular items. And that is something we have been consistently doing for a number of years, and we like that kind of strategy.

COLIN SEBASTIAN: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Macquarie.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE: There is a lot of interest and how the Kindle ecosystem actually impacts to the margin. I was wondering if you could just help us understand -- well, one question would be all-in Kindle hardware and software, the whole thing together, how is that impacting gross margin?

Then overall how should we think about how the agency model and the e-books, how that is going to impact margin?

Then just one quick one. There has been some speculation about the potential to bundle services with Amazon Prime. I was wondering if you could tell us how you think about that, and is that something that may be interesting in the future? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. First of all, we have a long-standing practice of not breaking out any individual products or categories. But what I can say about Kindle is it is growing very fast. We are extremely pleased with what we are seeing. We sold millions of devices in Q4. The content business -- the content part of it is growing very fast as evidenced by some of the comments we put in the earnings release.

So far quarter-to-date this quarter, again Q1, we have Kindle content, Kindle books sales growing at a faster rate than paperbacks, Which is really exciting. And so that business is going very well. And with the opportunity that we see there we are continuing to invest in that business. We think it is a very good business for us, and we are excited about the long-term opportunity there.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Banc of America - Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA - MERRILL LYNCH: One quick follow-up. Maybe you could explain why Kindle is a better business for Amazon?

And then, secondly, you talked about gross margin maybe not being the best way to measure the Company. Maybe you could explain why operating margin is better. And do you have individual management targets as far as compensation, or as a company as a whole on where you want to get to for operating margins? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: I am not sure I understood the first part of your question related to Kindle.

JUSTIN POST: I guess I am asking why Kindle is a better business than your traditional bookselling media business?

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, we happen to like both. Even though we are extremely excited about our Kindle business, our physical book business continues to grow as well. So we are very excited about both parts of our business.

And again, we think -- when I was mentioning Kindle, we just think it is a great opportunity for us. It has great tracks right now. Customers like it. We are able to offer so many titles right now in less than 60 seconds right to -- for a customer to be able to read.

One of the things you can't do with a physical book is you can't, from a service perspective with our model, it is very difficult to get it to the customer now. And with Kindle we can do that in less than 60 seconds. You can carry around your library with you very lightly.

And so we think it is just great for customers. We are seeing that the growth, both in terms of devices and content, is just fantastic. So we are continuing to invest and continuing to improve that experience for customers.

In terms of gross margins versus operating margins, we actually don't focus a lot on individual percentages, whether it be gross margins or operating margins. We are focused ultimately over the long term on free cash flow, free cash flow per share.

We like to look at return on invested capital. I mentioned earlier what our return on invested capital is today. That includes, appropriately so, the cash and marketable securities that we have in that balance. But certainly if we were to deploy that cash and return that to shareholders over time, you can see the underlying returns on invested capital ex cash are very high and in excess of 250% right now.

So we think it is a very efficient capital business. We think that we certainly like the model that we have and the opportunity that it brings to the shareholders over the long term.

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: A couple of questions. First of all, I guess when you look at the Kindle side of the equation, do you believe that the proliferation of Kindle apps across devices, not just your own device, is helping to increase the overall consumption of books across the industry or Amazon?

Then, second, I guess as it relates to international, where do you stand in terms of pan-European fulfillment capabilities, say shipping from Germany into the Netherlands into Scandinavia, et cetera?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Kindle apps we think it is good for customers that they can read their book -- their Kindle books on the other Kindle as well as many other devices. So that is what you see today. We have these apps so that it is easy for customers to be able to do that. Customers like that feature. And you should expect us to continue to expand that over time.

So how much it is contributing to overall growth is hard to say. But, again, customers are responding to the vast selection that we have, the good prices -- the great prices we have for Kindle content, the ease of which they can carry it around with them with a great convenience on their device, the Kindle device itself. So we are very excited about it.

In terms of fulfillment, we continue to work with our fulfillment to make it as seamless as possible for customers. That is really what it's all about in each of the geographies we are in. And we will continue to do so. So wherever we can make that service within Europe better for customers, we will. It will come from whatever fulfillment center makes sense.

JEETIL PATEL: If I may ask a follow-up. You have had tremendous growth in customers over the past year, about 24 million or so. Yet do you think that your lifetime value of the customer equation has changed, particularly as you looked at -- you have initiatives like Kindle and Prime?

Do you think that the economics have changed obviously for the better that you are acquiring more aggressively? Is that how we should think about some of these newer initiatives that you have had over the last several years that have been -- certainly they are pretty impactful?

TOM SZKUTAK: No, I think, not commenting on the lifetime value of customers, but we continue to offer new things for customers to make the experience better for customers. So we are adding new selection to make that better for customers. We are adding -- we launched Prime a number of years ago, which continues to grow, because we wanted to make sure that we could give great service to customers.

Many of our digital initiatives are around how do we make sure we get customers not only great -- give great pricing, great selection, but they get to have their content immediately.

So those are things that -- with us we start with the customer first. That is where our focus is. We found that by aligning with the customer it has been great for customers as well as great for shareholders over time. So that is the focus that we have had and the driver behind the initiatives over the past several years.

OPERATOR: Jim Friedland, Cowen and Company.

JIM FRIEDLAND, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: A question on marketing. If we look at marketing as a percentage of revenues this year it was up. And I believe you said one of the main reasons was the inclusion of Zappos. As we think about your marketing spend in 2011 is that the sort of seasonality and pattern that we should look for, or is anything changing in your approach to marketing? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, we did -- certainly we added -- continue to support the Zappos marketing spend in 2010 was a part of it. We are always looking for ways to reach customers through our marketing spend.

We also did -- you probably noticed a fair amount of Kindle ads during 2010, primarily starting, for the most part, heavier after Q1 of last year, which we saw great response to. So, again, those are some of the dynamics to think about.

JIM FRIEDLAND: Okay, great. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Steve Weinstein, Pacific Crest.

STEVE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST: I had a question on Prime membership. Now that it has been active in the US for quite a long time now, are you still seeing new members adopting Prime at a rapid rate? And I'm wondering when you think that may plateau as far as penetration in terms of the existing customer base?

TOM SZKUTAK: It is a good question. We are seeing adoption of Prime in our geographies continue to grow nicely. Customers like Prime. They like the service element of Prime. We have different offerings depending on the geography that we are offering it in. In the US you can get express two-day shipping for free. You get one-day and also some other offers in terms of weekend offers as well.

So, again, there are some interesting service elements to that, and customers are responding very well to it. It is both existing customers as well as -- sorry, existing Prime members as well as new Prime members. So it is going very well.

STEVE WEINSTEIN: I guess I am asking -- do you think you're reaching any sort of ceiling in terms of how many (multiple speakers)?

TOM SZKUTAK: No.

STEVE WEINSTEIN: No?

TOM SZKUTAK: No. And again, hard to tell when that would happen, but that certainly -- that is not what we are experiencing.

STEVE WEINSTEIN: Great, thank you.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Canaccord.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CANACCORD: I was wondering if you could give us a sense, is there a way to quantify the amount of time necessary for the recently opened distribution facilities to get to the same utilization level that you are seeing in the rest of the business? What kind of impact do you think that has on operating margins to the extent that you can quantify that for us?

In light of the investments this quarter, I guess it is worth at least asking, if you still feel like 10% is the right long-term operating margin to be thinking about for the total -- for the whole business?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, in terms of when these fulfillment centers will reach their optimum utilization and productivity, we are still getting productivity on existing fulfillment centers that we have had for quite some time. So it will be something that will evolve over a longer period of time. But again, if you look at the returns that we've gotten on the previous fulfillment centers that we have launched, they have been great uses of capital. So we are very happy about that.

In terms of your question on double-digit operating margins, we have said for a long time, and nothing has changed in that regard, we think that certainly double-digit operating margins are possible. If it means that we have some high single-digit operating margins that maximizes free cash flow, we are certainly okay with that and have room to go there.

But we are certainly focused on how do we get the best free cash flow, free cash flow per share, while getting great efficiency on our invested capital. So nothing has changed there.

HEATH TERRY: Great, thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: Sandeep Aggarwal, Caris & Company.

SANDEEP AGGARWAL, ANALYST, CARIS & COMPANY: Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, in our assessment there are many international markets which have grown healthier than the growth you achieved in Q4. I know it is a blended growth number and probably some FX dynamics, but are you saying any basically local e-commerce players getting stronger in international markets?

Secondly, any early signs of traction for the launch of the site in Italy? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, we grew 29% on a local currency basis for international, 26% on a dollar basis, a challenging compare from fourth quarter of 2009 where we certainly from a media perspective had one of our best growth rates that we have had in any quarter previously.

EGM grew at 50% on a local currency basis, so very strong growth. Again, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about other companies, but we are very pleased with what our international team is doing. We have a great opportunity there for further growth. In terms of Italy, very early, but pleased with what we are seeing so far, and like the opportunity there.

SANDEEP AGGARWAL: Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you.

OPERATOR: This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Eldridge, I will turn the conference back over to you.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Well, thanks everybody for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.

We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thanks everyone.

OPERATOR: Good day and welcome to the Amazon quarterly conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rob Eldridge, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

ROB ELDRIDGE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q2 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO, who will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

   TD
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 22, 2010, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about the factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for a comparable period of 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results.

Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 29% to $1.99 billion. Return on invested capital was 34%, down from 42%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 451 million shares.

Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $6.57 billion or 42% excluding the $48 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, fast selection with free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.

Media revenue increased to $2.87 billion, up 18%. EGM revenue increased to $3.49 billion, up 69%, or 70% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 53% of worldwide sales, up from 45%. Worldwide unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 118 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million, up 19%. Seller units were 32% of total units.

Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.61 billion, and gross margin was 24.5%.

Beginning this quarter we no longer allocate fulfillment costs related to third-party inventory to cost of sales. Using our prior method, gross margin in Q2 2010 was 24.1%.

Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $1.2 billion, or 18.3% of sales, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $558 million or 8.5% of revenue compared with 8.4%. Using our prior method of allocating fulfillment costs related to third-party inventory to cost of sales, Q2 2010 fulfillment was 8.1% of revenue.

Tech and content was $350 million or 5.3% of revenue compared with 5.5%. Marketing was $204 million, or 3.1% of revenue, up from 2.7% in the prior year.

Now I'll talk about our segment results; and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 46% to $3.59 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $1.32 billion. The sequential decline in quarter-over-quarter growth rates was driven primarily by seasonality in textbook sales and slower rates of growth in video games and video game consoles. EGM revenue grew 76% to $2.09 billion, representing 58% of North America revenues, up from 48%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $200 million, a 5.6% operating margin.

In the International segment, revenue grew 35% to $2.98 billion. Revenue growth was 38%, adjusting for the $54 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter.

Media revenue grew 20% to $1.55 billion, or 21% excluding foreign exchange rates, and EGM revenue grew 59% to $1.4 billion, or 63% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 47% of international revenues, up from 40%.

International segment operating income increased 15% to $206 million, a 6.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 21%. CSOI grew 34% to $406 million, or 6.2% of revenue, down 35 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $10 million unfavorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 37%.

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 71% to $270 million or 4.1% of net sales. Q2 2009 operating income was negatively impacted by a $51 million legal settlement. Our income tax expense was $88 million in Q2 or a 30% rate for the quarter. During the quarter we recorded estimated tax expense associated with tentative agreements between the Japanese and US tax authorities on the allocation of income between the US and Japan for 2003 through 2005, resulting in a 3-percentage-point increase in our effective tax rate for the quarter.

GAAP net income was $207 million, or $0.45 per diluted share compared with $142 million and $0.32 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.9 billion year-over-year to $5.11 billion. Inventory increased 46% to $1.94 billion, and inventory turns were 12.5, up from 12.4 turns a year ago, even as we expanded collections, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.

Accounts payable increased 41% to $3.55 billion, and accounts payable days were 65, unchanged from the prior year. Our Q2 2010 capital expenditures were $196 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including capacity to support our fulfillment operations, additional advancements in technology and infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and investments in corporate office space. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2010.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q3, we expect net sales of between $6.9 billion and $7.625 billion, or growth between 27% and 40%. This guidance anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates GAAP operating income to be between $210 million and $310 million, or between 16% decline and 24% growth. This anticipates approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between $340 million and $440 million, or between 3% decline and 26% growth.

We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting the customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

OPERATOR: (Operator instructions) Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Two questions -- first of all, I guess, as it relates to, broadly, fulfillment. I guess, can you talk about maybe a little bit more color on fulfillment capacity being layered into the business? Is that both domestic and international, or just more of a US kind of phenomenon? Maybe a bit more color on how much of this incremental capacity is being allocated to your partners, selling partners out there. And this is the build-out in front of the holiday season that you typically do?

And then, second, are you seeing consumers still buying more books in an environment where consumers have the Kindle app available on multiple devices these days?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of answering your first question, just to clarify on the fulfillment expense as a percentage of revenue, we have historically allocated some of our cost from operating expenses to COGS. And when we stopped reporting gross margins last quarter, we decided this quarter not to allocate some of our costs out of operating expenses into COGS. And the impact of that is a little over 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue. So, in other words, our operating expenses for fulfillment are about 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue higher than they would have been if we had not done this, and the offset is in COGS.

So that, if you take a look at it, those fulfillment expenses, we are growing very, very fast. And so we are adding capacity to support growth. And we plan on adding 13 fulfillment centers this year after keeping our fulfillment center structure relatively flat last year. We did add some capacity, but we're certainly adding a lot more this year. And that's, again, to support that growth. And that's both in terms of our retail customers as well as fulfilled by Amazon, our partners.

And your question around whether it's domestic or international -- it's across geographies, so it's 13 fulfillment centers across geographies. And so we are very excited about it because, again, we are experiencing a look at our overall growth rates at 42% on a local currency basis this quarter, 42% last quarter, 37% in Q4. So again, we are growing very, very strong.

Then, in terms of your second question, could you just elaborate a little bit further?

JEETIL PATEL: I think early on, when the Kindle device came out, you had actually talked about how consumers were purchasing more books through the Kindle device. Are you seeing now that you have a Kindle app that resides in multiple different devices, products out there in the marketplace, are you seeing consumers buy more books via the Kindle app?

TOM SZKUTAK: What we are seeing is strong growth on Kindle as well as the apps. So we are seeing very, very strong growth on Kindle. So it's really across the board, is what you're seeing.

JEETIL PATEL: Is this idea of the cloud-based computing for books really resonating with consumers today?

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm sorry; you cut out a little bit. I couldn't --

JEETIL PATEL: Is the idea of this cloud-based kind of format of reading or having availability of digital books resonating with consumers such that I can read my book on a PC, my BlackBerry and my iPhone and Kindle and switch around, depending on what's convenient for me?

TOM SZKUTAK: It certainly is. And customers can come and buy content on the Kindle and buy it once and use it everywhere, which is great. And so we are seeing -- as you probably saw in the release from earlier in the week, we are seeing very, very strong device growth, and we are seeing very, very strong content growth, and we are extremely pleased with what we are seeing there.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt. Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi, thanks, just one question, please. Tom, if you go back over the past four quarters, on average you had been beating the midpoint of your revenue guidance by approximately 7% and op income by about 27%. And in the second quarter, revenue was towards the high end of guidance, but the operating income was at the midpoint. So could you maybe talk about anything in the business that you felt that changed in the quarter, or how we should think about your forward operating guidance going forward, relative to now the past five quarters? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: When we set our guidance, we're trying to be very helpful. We are trying to give you our best forecast of what's going to happen during the quarter. We have had some times where we've been on the high end of that and then over it, but certainly when we provide guidance, that's not what we're trying to do. We're trying to give an accurate description of what we think the range will be. And so we approach it the same way every time, and we give the guidance that we think is appropriate. As you mentioned, our results today are well within -- it's in the top half for revenue guidance. It's also in the top half for consolidated segment operating income as well.

SCOTT DEVITT: Thanks.

OPERATOR: (Operator instructions) James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you, kind of one lengthy question. Could you talk about why the International operating margins are trending down, while the domestic operating margin is trending up? Does that primarily reflect mix shift in terms of third party and EGM within each market, or are more for 13 new fulfillment centers outside North America than inside it? And to what extent are the 13 new fulfillment centers already hitting expenses in the second quarter versus coming in, in the third quarter?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of International, first of all, I want to highlight a couple things related to international. International saw an accelerated growth this quarter. It was 38% growth on a local currency basis. That's the strongest growth rate in any quarter that we've had in international over five years. So we saw very good growth, and there's a number of things that's driving it. We've added a lot of selection over the past few years. When you look back and you see that just the categories that we've launched over the past few years, we continue to add selection in existing categories within those new categories that we've launched over the past few years, so that growth from new and existing categories is certainly doing quite well.

We are making sure that we're very competitive from a pricing standpoint, which is helping. And certainly, other things such as prime is having a noticeable impact on the growth rate there.

So that's really what's driving the growth rate. And with that accelerated growth rate in some of those newer categories, you're seeing some mix. Again, we have a number of categories that are very new there over the past few years and they are coming up to scale, but it's still very early. So you should assume that many of those are lower gross margin categories. And you can see that reflected in the EGM growth within International. So again, some very, very strong growth there.

In terms of fulfillment centers, I mentioned this to -- I think it was Jeetil's question earlier. The plan is to add 13. You are seeing some of the cost starting in Q2 for some of those fulfillment centers, and you see more, as reflected in our guidance, for Q3. But again, they are dispersed in a number of different geographies.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITI: (technical difficulty - background noise) Great, a couple of quick ones. The tax rate -- is there one-time items in there that sound like based on the way you described it, or is that the rate we should think about going forward?

Secondly, could you just give us the apples to apples North American and international gross margins under the old accounting methodologies?

And then, third, can you talk about marketing expenses? Those seem to have picked up. Is there some change in the strategy, or did you find market --

ROB ELDRIDGE: Mark?

MARK MAHANEY: -- (multiple speakers) more expensive this quarter?

ROB ELDRIDGE: Mark, it's Rob. We were unable to hear what you said, so were going to move on to the next caller. And --

TOM SZKUTAK: I've got a few of the pieces, and I'll try to --

ROB ELDRIDGE: You did?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. It was very scratchy. But we did mention on the tax rate, standpoint on our tax rate was 30%. Yes, if there was any one-time unusuals, I think is what you asked for -- there was one that I mentioned in my opening marks related to Japan, and we have a tentative agreement there. And the impact of that is about 300 basis points on that tax rate. So without that, it would have been about approximately 27% for the quarter.

In terms of marketing, you asked a question around marketing. Our approach has been consistent. The spend that you are seeing during the quarter is primarily online. If you're looking at the year-over-year growth that you're seeing in terms of basis points, certainly we have Zappos in our quarterly numbers, which we didn't have last year. And many of you probably saw the results prior to consolidating, and they were spending at a rate, percentage of revenue, at a much greater rate than Amazon was. And you should assume that they are still spending at a rate that's faster than Amazon, and that's reflected in that total.

You also may have noticed that we are doing some broad-scale advertising, TV advertising, for Kindle, which we think is the right thing to do and included in the number that you see there.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Banc of America/Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA/MERRILL LYNCH: It looks like you added 2200 people in the quarter. Could you explain where those people are mostly centered toward? Are they on the digital initiatives, maybe helping improve the Kindle, or are they more in fulfillment center-related?

Secondly, any time frame from when the personal ramp-up could slow down? Is it next year, or is it sooner than that?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the growth, sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, we did add 2200 people. The majority of those were operations people. And within that operations, the majority of those will just support new volume -- I should say the volume that we are seeing. And so, that's what's in there. The rest of the growth rate, you know, supporting the things that we've been talking about over the past several years, we're supporting new category growth both in North America and International. We are supporting the growth in Kindle, supporting our solar business, supporting our [fastly]-growing Web services business. Those are the things that we are supporting to grow our businesses going forward.

OPERATOR: Jim Friedland, Cowen & Company.

JIM FRIEDLAND, ANALYST, COWEN & COMPANY: Thanks, looking at free cash flow, it seems like it's unusually low for Q2. And it, I know, moves around, but it looks like part of the reason is it's ramping up on inventory a little earlier in the year. Can you provide some color around that?

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, our inventory -- actually, our turns improved slightly year-over-year, about a tenth of a turn. So we're pleased with what we see there. You're right; you do have some volatility in free cash flow. Certainly, one of the things that you're seeing is CapEx was $196 million in the quarter, which is up, and that's really in a few different pieces. But, certainly, the incremental spend relates to capacity that's both on the fulfillment side, as well as infrastructure side, and the infrastructure side to support our retail business as well as our fast-growing AWS business.

JIM FRIEDLAND: And, on that CapEx, should we look at that roughly $200 million you are spending per quarter? I know there's $100 million of incremental expense in for the year for the new facility move, but is that sort of a base line, excluding that facility impact?

TOM SZKUTAK: You should -- in terms of -- Q3 should be our highest quarter of the year so far, and you should expect that number to be more than $300 million during Q3. And again, we are adding -- we plan to add 13 fulfillment centers this year. We plan to add infrastructure capacity to support our fastly-growing business, which includes AWS. And on the fulfillment side, it's not just to support our retail business, but to support our FBA business, supporting our seller partners, so -- in addition to the office-based comment that you made.

JIM FRIEDLAND: Okay, great, that's helpful, thanks.

OPERATOR: (Operator instructions) Brian Pitz, UBS.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, UBS: One quick additional question on marketing. Should we expect an even larger ramp-up as a percent of revenue in Q4, given more aggressive spending on Kindle? And, can you talk about what's driving acceleration in other revenue? Is it Amazon product ads, or Web services?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sorry, Brian -- I heard the first question, but could you repeat the second part?

BRIAN PITZ: It's -- could you discuss the acceleration in other revenues? Is it some of your initiatives in Amazon product ads, or maybe Web services?

TOM SZKUTAK: Okay -- in terms of other revenue, there's a number of things that are in there. But certainly, our web services business is included in other revenue, and it's growing very fast. So we're certainly seeing that.

In terms of marketing, we are not giving guidance on any specific line item in Q3 in our guidance, and we are not giving any guidance at this point for Q4. But I would expect that we're going to approach marketing very similar to what you've seen over the past quarter. The vast majority of it will be online. We would still expect our Zappos team to continue to market as they have. And as you have seen so far this quarter, we've been doing some TV ads for Kindle during the quarter as well. So all of that would be included in our marketing and reflected in our guidance.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, Barclays Capital.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Great, thanks for taking the question. Tom, I was hoping you could comment on the North American media business. And in particular, it grew 15% on, certainly, an easier comp from last year. You point to a couple things there. But any more detail that you can provide here? And how much, I guess, in particular, is this related to the digital success that you are having through the Kindle? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: The growth rate, the deceleration that you see, is driven primarily by seasonality in textbook. We had -- and also, weakness in video games and maybe in consoles. From a text point standpoint, it's very seasonal, it's growing -- was growing very fast in Q1. It's not as much of an impact in Q2 as you would imagine; and then, the weakness in video games and video game consoles due to allocations on the console side and also lack of major releases. But in terms of growth on the book side, if you've seen the release earlier in the week, we're seeing very, very strong growth in the both Kindle device, which is in EGM, as well as Kindle content, which is in media. So it's growing very, very fast. But our physical book business, while the Kindle books are growing dramatically, is also growing double digits, year-over-year on the quarter. So we are very pleased with our overall book business, both our physical and digital business.

OPERATOR: Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks, good afternoon -- just, I guess, one housekeeping question, Tom. Can you give us a sense of roughly the impact from the Zappos acquisition in the quarter? And also, was there any impact from the change in the Kindle hardware accounting?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. In terms of those two pieces, we're not breaking those out. I think the way to think about it, though, is if you look at our EGM growth rate from North America, which is where those two things would occur, if you back those out, we still saw an accelerated growth rate. So again, we are not providing individual product line details in this case, but that's what we are seeing.

SPENCER WANG: And on the accounting change, Tom?

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, it's including both of those in that number, when I said that.

OPERATOR: Shawn Milne, Janney Capital Markets.

SHAWN MILNE, ANALYST, JANNEY CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks, just first on the housekeeping front, can you give us a sense for what kind of capacity -- as a percent of capacity that you would be adding with the 13 distribution centers? Any sense of magnitude there would be helpful.

And, secondly, if you can give us any color on just the pace of business through the second quarter, June relative to April.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the number of fulfillment centers, 13 is on a base of just under 40, and so -- to size it a little bit. And, in terms of pace, we don't give updates on inter-quarter. But, again, as you can see from our overall growth rate, we saw very, very strong growth in Q2, up 42% on a local currency basis, 46% for North America, 38% for International. International was the best growth rate of any quarter we've had in a little over five years, so it's very strong.

There was World Cup going on during about 20 days -- the last 20 days of the quarter, and hard to say what kind of impact that had, but I'm sure it had some impact. But that was included in that 38% growth on a local currency basis.

But again, we are not a bellwether for the economy, and we focus very hard on expanding selection and making sure we have great prices and making sure that we have great convenience for customers, including Amazon Prime. So those are the things that we're focused on, and it's really what's driving the growth that you see today.

SHAWN MILNE: Just a quick follow-up on the 13 distribution centers out of the 40-plus -- I'm assuming that these are more regional in nature and that, blended the average, the square footage would be a little bit lower than what we've seen from some of the early distribution centers. Is that a fair take?

TOM SZKUTAK: It was 13 on just under 40, and not just over 40. And we're not providing the square footage details, but I would think of them as varying size in different regions.

SHAWN MILNE: Okay, thank you.

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JP Morgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JP MORGAN: Thank you so much taking my questions; a couple of questions -- first, it seems like CapEx grew fifth straight quarter and it was like (inaudible) [3]% of your revenue, and depreciation and amortization grew like 53%. So, how should we think about the CapEx? What is driving this CapEx growth? So that's question number one.

And question number two, it seems like, high end, you're guiding 40% revenue growth, but operating income growth rate of 24%. So what's driving the de-leverage?

And the third, a housekeeping question -- how many Kindle apps for iPad has been downloaded -- can you give us some sense on that? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. I'll take your CapEx question first. The largest pieces of the increase are related to capacity, and it's capacity both from a fulfillment perspective and an infrastructure perspective. When I say fulfillment, it's to support our fast-growing retail business as well as our fast-growing filled by Amazon business where we fill on behalf of our partners.

From an infrastructure standpoint, we are supporting, again, our retail business. But also, we have an AWS business that's growing very, very strong right now. And so we are supporting that growth by adding CapEx. So that's what's included in the CapEx.

In terms of the range of guidance, I just wanted to clarify a little bit. You said the upper end of the range was 40%. Keep in mind that that anticipates approximately 300 basis points of unfavorable exchange rate, so at the high end of the range it's more like 43%, as well as on the bottom end of the range for CSOI, you mentioned 24%. It's actually 26%, and that anticipates approximately 600 basis points of exchange. So the high end of the range would be 43% growth ex-exchange for revenue, 32% growth ex- -- excuse me. On the high end of the range, 43% excluding exchange for revenue, and 32% growth excluding exchange on CSOI. And again, it reflects our best estimate for the high end of that range and the things that we see.

But again, it anticipates some of the things that I'm talking about. It anticipates the capacity that will show up in CapEx as well as operating expense across a number of different fronts. And then, the rest of the operating expenses in support of the things that we've been talking about again for the last several years -- it's the growing retail business, both in North America and international, our seller business, AWS, our Kindle business, seller business, if I didn't say that. So, again, those are the things that we are adding resources to, to support the opportunities that we see going forward.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, Lazard.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, LAZARD CAPITAL MARKETS: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first, one clarification on the media segment, given the questions there. Was the performance in that segment under your expectations for the quarter? Secondly, I'm curious about your view of the consumer environment versus 90 days ago and if you are preparing for this holiday period any differently than maybe you were last year at this time. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: We are very, very pleased with the media growth, and so we are very pleased with what we saw. We are extremely pleased with our Kindle content growth. And, again, as I mentioned, our physical books also grew double digits year-over-year during the quarter, so we are very, very pleased with our overall books business as related to that. And, again, we saw our sequential decline based on primarily the textbook sales seasonality, and also some weakness in video games and video game consoles, again due to allocations and lack of major releases.

Even though we saw weakness in our video games and video game console business, we are still very pleased with that business, and we think the team is doing a great job in terms of the fundamentals, supporting customers. And we like the opportunities that we see there.

In terms of the consumer sentiment, again, I don't think we are the bellwether. What we're seeing is reflected in our Q2 results, which were, from a growth standpoint, very, very strong.

COLIN SEBASTIAN: All right, thanks very much.

OPERATOR: Sandeep Aggarwal, Caris & Company.

SANDEEP AGGARWAL, ANALYST, CARIS & COMPANY: Thanks for taking my questions; actually, I have two questions. One is, Tom, can you talk about maybe the average selling price for the Kindle e-books? And even if you don't want to talk about the exact pricing, maybe directionally how they have trended last two quarters. And secondly, the price reduction in Kindle device in June -- is it fair to assume that it was gross margin-agnostic? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the ASP in Kindle, I can't help you with the average, but what I can help you with is, if you take a look at some of the details that we provided earlier in the week, and I'll point you to that release where we have over 630,000 titles, 510,000 of those were $9.99 or below. That excludes the $1.8 million pre-1923 free content that we have on the Kindle. So there's just great values and great selection for customers, and we are seeing that customers are responding to that great selection. And the convenience of device, the convenience of the apps, the fact that you can buy it once on Kindle, read it in many different places, is really important to customers. And again, there's great values there as well.

SANDEEP AGGARWAL: And, Tom, just in terms just in terms of the growth, the price reduction in the Kindle device -- is it (multiple speakers) --?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, I'm not commenting on the individual margins of any product line. But what I would say is, not unlike any product that we sell, we are trying to make sure that we can get it to the best values to customers, and we are committed to doing that. And we think we are very fortunate to see, when we dropped our price from $259 down to $189, we saw a tripling of growth rate, which we are extremely pleased to see. And we are very happy with our Kindle business, and it has great momentum right now.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, FBR Capital Markets.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS: Great, thanks; first, just quickly, can you give us a sense of what kind of traction you are seeing for Kindle at Target since the rollout there? And then, looking at the category expansion in International, how much expansion do you have left, given the verticals that you've added before the offering outside the US starts to parallel what you're offering inside the US?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Target, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about any results from a specific partner, but we are pleased overall with our growth in Kindle all the way around, and we are pleased with our relationship there.

In terms of International, we are still having a lot of selection in international, in each of the categories that we are in, older categories that we have been in for years, as well as the newer categories that I mentioned earlier, and still think there's a tremendous opportunity to add selection there.

Keep in mind that we also have within International an opportunity to add new geographies and new categories and selection, obviously, in those geographies. So, we think there's great opportunities there.

HEATH TERRY: Great, thank you.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Thank you for joining the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website released through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com first-quarter 2010 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.

ROB ELDRIDGE, VP, IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 22, 2010 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about the factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

   TD
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP & CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Rob. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 62% to $2.32 billion. Return on invested capital is 45%, up from 41%. ROIC is TT and free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 463 million shares compared with 447 million. Worldwide revenue grew 46% to $7.13 billion or 42%, excluding the $185 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.

We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.

Media revenue increased $3.43 billion, up 26% or 22% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $3.51 billion, up 72% or 68% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 49% of worldwide sales, up from 42%. Worldwide unit growth was 40%. Active customer accounts exceeded $114 million. For the first time, this number includes our Amazon China customer accounts. Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately $2 million, up 22%. Sales units were 31% of total units.

Consolidated gross profit grew 42% to $1.63 billion, and gross margin decreased 62 basis points to 22.9%. We no longer present gross profit in our consolidated statement of operations as we believe income from operations is a more meaningful measure due to the diversity of our product categories and services. Our focus is on growing operating profit dollars rather than maximizing percentages.

Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technical content and G&A combined was $1.12 billion or 15.8% of sales, down 115 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $528 million or 7.4% of revenue compared with 8.3%. Technical content was $319 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 4.9%. Marketing was $196 million or 2.7% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year.

Now I will talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 47% to $3.78 billion. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.6 billion. EGM revenue grew 73% to $2.02 billion, representing 54% of North America's revenues, up from 45%. North America segment operating income increased 81% to $273 million, a 7.2% operating margin.

In the international segment, revenue grew 45% to $3.35 billion. Revenue growth was 37%, adjusting for the $175 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 29% to $1.83 billion or 23%, excluding FX. In EGM revenue grew 70% to $1.49 billion or 61%, excluding FX. EGM now represents 44% of international revenues, up from 38%.

International segment operating income increased 37% to $234 million, a 7% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 26%. CSOI grew 58% to $507 million or 7.1% of revenue, up 53 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $15 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 53%.

Unlike CSOI our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 62% to $394 million or 5.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $100 million in Q1 or a 25% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $299 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared with $177 million and $0.41 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $2.33 billion year over year to $5.06 billion. Inventory increased 44% to $1.82 billion, and inventory turns were 12.6, up from 12.5 turns a year ago, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories.

Accounts Payable increased 52% to $3.62 billion, and Accounts Payable days increased to 59 from 57 in the prior year.

Our Q1 2010 capital expenditures were $140 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services; additional investments in support of continued business growth, including capacity to support fulfillment operations; and investments in corporate office space, which we expect to continue throughout 2010.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by as many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.

It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intracompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates, can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q2 we expect net sales of between $6.1 billion and $6.7 billion or growth of between 31% and 44%. This anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. Cap operating income to be between $220 million and $320 million or to grow between 39% and 102%. The second-quarter 2009 results include the impact of our settlement with Toys "R" Us for $51 million, substantially all of which was expensed during the quarter. This includes approximately $130 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between $350 million and $450 million, a growth of between 15% and 48%.

We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe that putting the customer first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Colin Sebastian, Lazard Capital Markets.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, LAZARD CAPITAL MARKETS: Congratulations on a very strong quarter. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the same day delivery program, how that is playing out in cities where it is offered, and is this something that could be rolled out more broadly if successful in testing in the existing markets?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Probably the best way to describe it is similar to other programs that we have related to fast shipping, meaning Prime. We are finding that customers like it. We certainly think that customers like the reliability of getting their products so efficiently so quickly, and it's hard to say what we will do beyond what we're doing today with same day. But we certainly think that getting a product to customers fast is important.

OPERATOR: James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Actually two questions. One is, with regards to the very large active customer number, that includes China but not Zappos? I just wanted to check. I assumed they would like 5 million each from China and from Zappos if you did include Zappos.

And then secondly, when I look at the expansion in North American operating margins in the quarter, was that helped by sales of digital media and also Amazon Web Services?

TOM SZKUTAK: I will take the second part first. The North America expansion was driven by a number of things. Certainly the very strong growth and then it was also driven by us being able to leverage our overall expenses. If you take a look at our global fulfillment costs as a percentage of revenue, you can certainly see a lot of leverage there, and that is also true when you look at North America. We have not added any significant capacity in North America since Q3 of '08. Certainly with the growth rates that you are seeing, you should expect that we will be adding capacity over time there. But again, it was driven by a lot of different factors and with a lot of different product categories growing very strong and us being able to leverage those expenses.

In terms of the first part, could you repeat the first part again? It was related to --

JAMES MITCHELL: (multiple speakers) -- from the customers, did that include China and also Zappos or just China, and is it fair to assume that each of China and Zappos would contribute about 5 million active customers?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, you are correct. The active customer number does not include Zappos, but it does include China this quarter for the first time. And we are not at this point breaking out the addition of China at this point. So it is 114 million active customers worldwide at this point.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, Barclays Capital.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Just two quick questions. Can you comment on the headcount? It looks like it went up by about 1800 people on a sequential basis, certainly a larger number than we would have expected. And then the second one is just the tax rate being a little bit higher at 25%. Is that purely just the function of higher North America profit?

TOM SZKUTAK: The first part in terms of headcount, the biggest piece of that is related to fulfillment. Coming out of Q4, we always have certain people additions related to that. So again, a sizable piece of that incremental headcount was due to operations, and the rest was certainly in areas to help us grow as we move forward.

In terms of the effective tax, certainly the mix of our geographies is certainly what is making that change, yes.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Jefferies & Co.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO.: Two quick questions for Tom. First, one of your competitors talks about seeing some weakness in Europe, ex-UK. Looking at your international margins, it looks like they came a little bit under pressure. They were down by about 40 or 50 bps year on year. Is that something you guys saw as well?

And then by our estimates, the change in accounting for Kindle that you instituted in Q1 resulted again at least by our math in somewhere between $80 million and $100 million of additional revenues for the quarter. Can you maybe just help us understand if we are in the right ZIP code there?

TOM SZKUTAK: The first question, we are not bringing out individual geographies within the international segment. But what you are seeing in international is very strong growth, and we were pleased across all of our geographies. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, we saw growth of 37%, which is certainly very good, and it was driven by a number of things.

Certainly we have added many new categories and a lot of selections over the past few years. We certainly have -- we are focused on making sure that we have great competitive low prices, which is certainly fueling growth. Prime is also a factor, and third-party growth continues to be very strong. So those are the factors that are driving the international growth.

In terms of the change in accounting for Kindle, we are not breaking out any precise numbers on that. But the way you should think about it is maybe a few different items. One is, if you look at our overall growth rate and you look at it on a local currency basis, we certainly have for the first time a full quarter of Zappos included in those numbers, as well as the change in accounting for Kindle. And if you back out exchange in those two items and you compare it to the equivalent growth rate in Q4, you did see a few hundred basis points acceleration in growth from Q4 to Q1. So I cannot give you much more of a breakout than that, but you can see that we did see an acceleration of growth there.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, UBS.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, UBS: With your comment on the impetus to begin selling the Kindle through brick-and-mortar stores, then do you expect to make the device more widely available? Also, I'm just curious why the rollout is limited to so few stores.

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, it is starting with a small number of stores. But we are very pleased to be working with Target, and we think we are very pleased to have even more customers see Kindle and have the opportunity to purchase Kindle. So that is why we are doing it, and we are very excited to do it.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citi.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITI: I know why you may not want to talk so much about gross margins. I understand you're running the business for operating profits and then cash flow. But could you provide a little bit more color on the gross margin trends, particularly in international markets, given what should be some pretty positive mix shifts and scale factors, but mix shifts towards the digital goods and AWS and things like that. The trends seem a little surprising. Anything in terms of vendor terms, product mixes that may have explained the gross margin trends.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of international -- it was primarily driven by certainly a number of factors. We continue to have lower prices and make sure that we have great competitive prices obviously in a challenging environment, which includes free shipping offers and Amazon Prime included in that. And, keep in mind, that we have launched many new categories over the past few years. So, as we have talked about in the past, it takes some time to get the scale in those categories, and we are seeing very broad growth across many categories, including the new categories. And so certainly that mix is having an impact, and all those factors are being partially offset by a very strong solid third-party growth, as well as the savings that we will get from our vendor partners. So again, those are the key drivers.

MARK MAHANEY: And one quick follow-up on marketing for the Kindle, is there any change in your thinking of the level of marketing support you will provide given obviously a much more competitive environment?

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, you know, in terms of marketing itself, you saw that it increased a little bit as a percentage of revenue year over year. We are doing advertising for Kindle. It is certainly a product in an area that we are very excited about. You have probably seen some of the ads that we are doing, as well as doing online marketing.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: The first-quarter operating margin was 7.1%, and at the midpoint of revenue and operating margin on a cash basis in 2Q, I think it is 6.3%. So, Tom, could you just talk through what the factors are that would drive operating margin down sequentially that order of magnitude?

And then secondly, stock-based compensation I think you guided to $110 million and did $87 million and then guided to $130 million in 2Q. So what is the volatility in that line item in the first quarter and going forward?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. I will take the second part first. The $87 million is actually the equivalent of stock-based compensation amortization of intangibles, which is $113 million. And so it has gone from $113 million to $130 million.

In terms of the operating margin, we are not giving operating margin guidance for Q2. But the implied operating margin we do have a -- consistent with what we have done in prior periods, we have a range of operating income, and that range is $350 million to $450 million. At the lower end of the range, it is 5.7% of implied operating margin and 6.7% on the high end. On the high end, you would see an expansion of operating margins of approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. And so that's the guidance based on what we see by looking at all the factors. And so there's not much I can help you with that.

I would -- one thing to keep in mind, though, as I mentioned in one of the earlier questions, with growth we are experiencing, we need to make sure we support that growth. And what that means is we will continue to add capacity in our various businesses to support that growth, whether it be our retail business, our AWS business, or our third-party seller business, including [FPA]. So those are things that we certainly are supporting given the growth that we are having.

The other thing is we will continue as we have in prior years. We still think there is a lot of opportunity in front of us. And so, as we have in prior years, we will make sure that we are judicious about where we make those additions, but we will add resources to make sure that we capitalize on those growth opportunities. So those are the things that we are thinking about.

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Two questions. I guess the unit growth nicely accelerated from the fourth-quarter levels, and the trend line you have been seeing historically, I guess can you talk about whether that is more of a function of the domestic business and still seeing very good purchase frequency or international now participating as Prime has now been out there for well north of two years?

And then second just broader question, but in a world where we are going towards mobile and smartphones from an immediate consumption standpoint, can you, I guess, talk about what is the opportunity from an e-commerce standpoint? Do you think that it will be just as good of an e-commerce-oriented environment on a mobile device as you see in an desktop Internet world since it is a smaller form factor, smaller screen? How do you have to change if you have to in terms of how you present information to consumers?

TOM SZKUTAK: I will take the second part of your question first. We are excited about the idea that the world may shift to a place where 3G connected devices are available to browse the net. And our view is that the more Web connected devices whether it be tablets or smartphones, the better that it is for our retail business as you are suggesting. We will figure out the best way to make sure that we make it as easy as possible for our customers to purchase from those devices. But we think that it is an exciting opportunity to have a world that looks like that.

In terms of your unit question, as you can probably expect, given the growth we are seeing both in North America and in international from a revenue perspective, we are seeing very good growth in units as well. And so we are very pleased with the unit growth we are seeing in both segments.

JEETIL PATEL: I guess does that I guess on the former question that I asked about how mobile changes the world, does that give you an advantage as you look at your recommendations capability, what you have been building in terms of that database and cross-comparison of what people are buying in terms of across categories and products? And then I guess is it international growth that is incrementally much better on units that is driving it. It seems like domestic has been good, but international seems to be kicking in even more so these days than ever before.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the -- again, your unit question is related to mobile or is it related to total?

JEETIL PATEL: Total.

TOM SZKUTAK: No, again, the unit growth is very broad. And so again, when you see the results that we had with on a local currency basis international being up 37%, this is revenue I'm speaking, as well as North America again was up 47%, 46% on a local currency basis. You're seeing strong revenue growth. You are also seeing very strong unit growth in those two segments. And in terms of mobile, we are going to use -- obviously try to make sure that we learn as much as we can and try to serve our customers the best we can in that environment. But it is an environment that we like. Again, the idea of having easy access from a Web perspective on wireless devices is a world that we like. So again, we are going to do whatever we can to make sure it is easy for customers to get access.

OPERATOR: Steve Weinstein, Pacific Crest.

STEVE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST: I don't know if you you would be willing to disclose it, but I'm trying to get a better understanding of how might Zappos impacted the quarter. If you could at least give us a sense of what the organic growth would have been without that. But I also would love to know if there's any other impact to the P&L. I just wanted to make sure the worldwide unit growth of 40%, that is excluding Zappos, correct?

TOM SZKUTAK: No. The worldwide unit growth includes Zappos. The impact on some of the -- someone had asked that -- I apologize -- someone had asked a similar question earlier. We are not breaking out Zappos results specifically as part of our total. But what I had mentioned was, if you take our worldwide results on a local currency and growth basis and you back out Zappos and the Kindle accounting change, you see a growth rate that accelerated from Q4. And that is accelerated versus what we saw in Q4, excluding exchange and excluding Zappos.

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JPMorgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: I have two quick modeling questions and then one more of a big picture question. In terms of modeling questions, I think on your other operating expenses/income net was $26 million, could you explain what that was, please?

And secondly, fulfillment seems like it came down quite a bit at 7.4% of revenue. Is that sustainable? How should we think about that?

And the long-term question is, I think the shareholder letter Jeff talked about how you launched 21 categories worldwide. Can you give us some sense how long it takes to ramp those categories, how long it takes to get to the peak margins now that we have the experience of launching many different categories over the last many, many years. So that would be very helpful. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Could you just repeat -- there was a part in the middle there that I missed. You said something about 7.4%. I did not hear --

IMRAN KHAN: That is the fulfillment. Fulfillment as a percentage of revenue, I believe, was 7.4%.

TOM SZKUTAK: Does your question relate to that?

IMRAN KHAN: Yes, so that is down 80 basis points year over year. So I was trying to figure out if that is a one-time thing or how should we think about it? Is that sustainable, trying to figure out what is driving that leverage?

TOM SZKUTAK: I will start with the fulfillment one first. What you are seeing there is we saw accelerated growth, and when you see accelerated rate, we are able to leverage that in our fulfillment capacity in a great way from a productivity standpoint. Also, what I had mentioned was we have added capacity, but specifically in North America we have not added any meaningful capacity since Q3 of '08.

And if you recall, we were building capacity, and then we had a financial disruption in the market. So we ended up having some excess capacity in Q4 of '08. We have been able to leverage that capacity throughout, and so that is resulting in the productivity that you are seeing.

Now with the growth that we are experiencing, you should expect that we will have to add capacity over time here to satisfy that growth.

In terms of your category question, we have learned a lot over the years, but it still takes us a number of years to get the scale when we launch new categories. One of the things we have learned over the past several years is we need to make sure that we have great selection day one. We need to make sure that we are pricing very competitively day one, even though we do not have necessarily the scale or the buying tools to purchase well day one.

And so what that means usually is that we will have a lower contribution profit per unit generally early on. And, as we learn those categories, we get better and better at sourcing and making sure we have the right inventory in place and all that. So it takes a number of years before we get the scale in those categories and get meaningful free cash flow out of them.

ROB ELDRIDGE: In regard to your question on what is behind the $26 million of operating expense, remember that we are amortizing intangibles in that line item. There is a number of things that go into that, but it really is predominantly amortization of intangible assets.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Broadpoint AmTech.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, BROADPOINT AMTECH: I'm wondering if you could discuss some initiatives around used products and particularly in EGM and what the strategy is there going forward?

Another question would be discuss your private label strategy. Are there any new trends there, any new categories that we should know about?

And then finally, just for the modeling, was there any meaningful impact from videogame hardware shortages this quarter?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of used products, our strategy has been pretty consistent. We have a platform that is available for sellers to sell used product, which is the predominant use. We try to make that experience as good as we can both for the sellers and for customers so they can understand what the quality of the good is before making a purchase decision.

We have done some private label as you mentioned. There is not really a lot to speak of today about that. But again, we do have some private label products out that we sell. But the vast majority of the products we sell are not private label.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BANK OF AMERICA/MERRILL LYNCH: A couple of things. First, I know your Company does not like to waste money. Usually you have a revenue decline into the summer, and you ramp up your facilities and your people kind of in third quarter. Why earlier this year? Do you feel really bullish as we go into the summer period?

And then just to clarify, are you saying all of the acceleration on an ex-currency basis from 1Q versus 4Q is due to Zappos and Kindle amortization?

TOM SZKUTAK: I will start with the last question first. No, on a global basis, excluding exchange, Kindle and the accounting change, we saw a few hundred basis points acceleration in growth. So we did accelerate excluding those items.

In terms of capacity, we are -- we do have high growth rates right now. We have 40% unit growth, 46% revenue growth in Q1. You see the guidance for Q2. And so, as you would expect with that growth rate, we need to make sure we have the right amount of capacity and people on hand to serve.

As part of that from a fulfillment perspective, we are growing our fulfilled by Amazon, our FDA business, which also requires capacity to do so. So those are things that we view as high quality problems, but those are things that we certainly will have to add as we move forward, as well as other areas, other parts of our business that are growing in addition to those two.

JUSTIN POST: But you said that you are investing earlier this year than normal, or is it just maybe a little bit of a catchup to last year? How would you phrase that, would you say?

TOM SZKUTAK: You know, I guess I would characterize it as we are trying to make sure we satisfy demand in our retail business and our third-party business that we fulfill, as well as Web Services businesses. So those are the things we are trying to do in making sure that we have the right capacity on hand.

OPERATOR: Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: A question on e-books. I guess, as you and the industry move more toward the agency model for digital books, it shifts the ability to set pricing to publishers. I guess our understanding is you also have to charge sales tax, also. So it would seem that your ability to leverage low price may be mitigated a little bit. So I was wondering if you could just talk about how you would adjust your model to differentiate Amazon versus some of the other players in the context of the other two pillars, I guess, convenience and selection that you are focused on?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. One of the things that we are doing is we are expanding selection pretty dramatically. When we launched two plus years ago with Kindle, we had approximately 90,000 titles. Just recently we passed over 500,000 titles. And so our vision, as we stated when we launched Kindle, is to have every book ever published in any language available for customers in under 60 seconds. And that is still our stated long-term goal. And so we're going to continue to add selection in support of that vision.

OPERATOR: That does conclude our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rob Eldridge for any additional or closing remarks.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Great. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: And that does conclude today's call. We do appreciate everyone's participation.

   LP
OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2009 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.

For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead.

   TD
ROB ELDRIDGE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2009 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. As Jeff is traveling today, Tom and I will be available for Q&A.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2009 only, will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results from the comparable period of 2008. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 89% to $1.54 billion. Return on invested capital is 42%, up from 29%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow, divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 451 million shares compared with 446 million.

Worldwide revenue grew 14% to $4.65 billion or 20%, excluding the $227 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $2.44 billion, up 1%, or 7%, excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $2.07 billion, up 35% or 41%, excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 45% of worldwide sales, up from 38%. Worldwide unit growth was 28%. Active customer accounts exceeded 94 million, up 16%.

Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.7 million, up 21%. Seller units were 30% of total units. Worldwide gross profit was $1.13 billion, up 17%.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $829 million or 17.8% of sales, unchanged year-over-year. Fulfillment was (technical difficulty) [$389 million] or 8.4% of revenue, while tech and content was $253 million or 5.5% of revenue. Marketing was $124 million or 2.7% of revenue, up 23 basis points from the prior year.

Now I'll talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we cannot allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense, income net line item.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 13% to $2.45 billion. Media revenue was flat at $1.15 billion, with declines in some categories, particularly video games and video game consoles, offset by growth in books.

EGM revenue grew 29% to $1.19 billion, representing 48% of North America revenues, up from 42%. Kindle sales continued to exceed our expectations, and we reduced the price of Kindle, the number one bestseller in our consumer electronics store to $299.

North American gross profit grew 20% to $672 million, and gross margin increased 161 basis points (technical difficulty) [to 27.4%], driven by increases in third-party product sales, improvement in inventory management, including vendor pricing, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 30% to $125 million, a 5.1% operating margin.

In the International segment, revenue grew 16% to $2.2 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusted for the $221 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter.

Media revenue grew 3% to $1.29 billion or 12%, excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 45% to $882 million or 60%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 40% of International revenues, up from 32%.

International gross profit grew 13% to $461 million or grew 27%, excluding FX. While gross margin decreased 56 basis points to 20.9%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales.

International segment operating income increased 20% to $179 million, and 8.1% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 43%.

CSOI grew 24% to $304 million or 6.5% of revenue, up 51 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $30 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 37%.

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense income. GAAP operating income fell 27% to $159 million or 3.4% of net sales. Second quarter 2009 operating income including the impact of our settlement with Toys 'R' Us for $51 million, substantially all of which was expensed during the quarter. A one-time payment from Amazon.com will take place in third quarter 2009.

Additionally, included in the second quarter of 2008 GAAP operating income was a $53 million non-cash gain recognized on the sale of our European DVD rental assets.

Our income tax expense was $39 million in Q2 or a 22% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $142 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared with $158 million and $0.37 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet -- cash and marketable securities increased $831 million year-over-year to $3.21 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government, and government agencies securities, AAA rated money market funds and other investment-grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value.

Inventory increased 20% to $1.32 billion, and inventory turns decreased to 12.4 from 13.0 a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories.

Accounts payable increased 28% to $2.51 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 65 from 58 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $330 million from a year ago to $981 million. Our Q2 2009 capital expenditures was $78 million.

Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Zappos. Zappos is a customer-focused company. We see great opportunities for both companies to learn from each other and create even better experiences for our customers.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies among subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates, can all have a material effect on guidance.

Our guidance excludes Zappos' financial result and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q3, we expect net sales of between $4.75 billion and $5.25 billion, a growth of between 11% and 23%. This guidance anticipates approximately 150 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange rates; GAAP operating income to be between $120 million and $210 million, or between 22% decline and 36% growth. This includes approximately $95 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between [$215 million] and $305 million, or between 7% decline and 32% growth.

We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability, including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Mark Mahaney, Citi.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Great. I'd like to ask about the North American trends, particularly gross margins and media sales, and to what extent there's a link there. Last quarter, you had a pretty positive gross margin trend. You repeated it this quarter; but last quarter, it seemed to be because of some access to -- unusual access to inventory.

Was that effect still in place in the second quarter? Or is there something going on in terms of the mix shift within media sales towards digital products, that's really boosting those gross margins? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks, Mark. I'll start with the gross margin question. We saw, in North America and in International, we saw very solid 3P product sales. So, 3P is certainly impacting margins.

We had very good execution on a lot of other areas, including inventory management. We had very good pricing with our suppliers, which is offset partially, certainly, by lower prices for our customers as well as product mix. So that's really what's driving the gross margins.

In terms of the North America media growth, we saw -- just as a reminder, I mentioned on the last call, we had very strong revenue growth Q2 of last year -- which includes, if you look at it versus really any other quarter, over the past several quarters, it's our strongest quarter -- including the growth that we saw in North American media, which was up 25%.

And we had some declines in some categories, particularly video games and consoles. Video games and consoles are very, very strong last year. And we had both console growth and video games themselves seeing strong growth. Three of our four best releases of last year were released during Q2, including We Fit.

And so, that was included in our Q2 last year, and was driving the growth last year, and we're overlapping that. And so what you're really seeing is an industry slowdown in video games and consoles.

And then we had books growth offsetting that decrease. So, those are the factors that were included in there.

And just another note. On the video games, even though we saw a decline, we're actually very happy with that category. We have added a lot of selection since last year. We've -- our in-stock levels improved dramatically from last year, and there's a number of other things the team has done to make that customer experience even better.

So we're very pleased with the customer experience we're providing there, and what we're seeing is an industry slowdown, which we saw the effect of that in our growth rates.

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: A couple of questions. As you look at Fulfillment by Amazon, I guess can you talk a little bit more about the impact you're seeing from FBA on the businesses, in the form of just margin contribution? Is it in the form of unit growth? Or just a pickup in customer growth? I guess, a little bit more on how FBA so far is influencing the business or affecting the business.

Second, if you look at Prime internationally, I guess, is Prime internationally helping to drive kind of the same behavior trends by region in the UK, German, and Japanese markets as you rolled it out? And you've been in there for about a year and a half to two years now?

TOM SZKUTAK: Those two programs specifically we're extremely pleased with. Prime, on a global basis, is doing very well. And in International, we're seeing -- we are seeing very similar trends to what we saw when we launched in the US. It's been very successful for us.

When you look at our international growth rate, up 28% year-over-year on a local currency basis, and that's with -- actually, if you look compared to Q2, you saw 20% growth rate as well in Q2, but we had a favorable comparison with the Easter holiday and an unfavorable comparison in 2Q. So, we had very strong growth rate and certainly Prime is helping that growth rate.

In terms of FBA, there's not a lot in terms of specifics from a margin standpoint I can provide today; but Prime is growing very well and it's certainly impacting our third-party growth. And our third-party growth from a units perspective is 30% as a percentage of total units, which was up by year-over-year, again, in Q2. So we're pleased with the growth rate and certainly FBA is [kind of] contributing to that.

JEETIL PATEL: Is the biggest influence on units or customers?

ROB ELDRIDGE: Customer adds.

TOM SZKUTAK: There's not a lot I can add to that. I apologize.

OPERATOR: Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley.

MARY MEEKER, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Scott and I had a couple questions. First, to extend on Mark Mahaney's question a little bit -- are you -- you said, in effect, you're not really seeing a slowdown in your media business from any digital transitions that are taking place in music or video. So that's sort of a question.

And another question is, your EGM business is doing extremely well. Can you correlate any of the things that are going on with digital media transitions with upticks in your products that play those products, if you will?

And then on mobile, and a question for Jeff, we are seeing tremendous e-commerce momentum in other parts of the world. And we have -- we're starting to see it in the US, you have a great app for Amazon on the iPhone. You have a great Kindle app, you have a great Stanza app. Is it your view that mobile can be a material portion of Amazon's revenue in the next few years?

TOM SZKUTAK: I'll take the media one first. Certainly, there's industry -- there's some certainly slowness in some of the media categories. And we're seeing some of that slowness reflected in the North America results that you see.

But in terms of what's happened recently, from a trend standpoint, it's clearly the challenging pair that we had versus last year, as well as the video games impact that I mentioned.

In terms of digital, it's still very early. And we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of growth of our various digital products that we offer -- text, video, and music. But it's still very early and we're seeing very good unit growth there. And we're very pleased with what we see there.

From an EGM perspective, there's not a lot I can give you in terms of the individual growth rates of some of those items that you mentioned, but we're seeing very good broad-based growth within EGM. We did see some slowness to some of the higher selling priced items, but outside of that, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. Overall unit growth globally remains very strong. So we're very pleased with that.

In terms of mobile, it's a great question. And I apologize, Mary, Jeff is not on the call today. He's traveling and just from a scheduling standpoint, it didn't work. But again, it's -- we certainly think that mobile is an opportunity. As you mentioned, there is a number of applications that we have. We're going to continue to innovate in that space, and it's difficult to say how big that could be over time, but it's certainly something that we're excited about and we're investing in.

UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And Tom, this is Scott. I had just one follow up, if I could. The operating margin guidance that you gave, the midpoint was 5.2%. And this quarter, in the second quarter, the midpoint of your guidance was 5.3%; you did 6.5%, which is the highest operating margin since the third quarter of '05.

So I understand there's some one-time dynamics going on in the industry right now, but you didn't have great visibility to that over-performance in Q2, and I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit to the conservativism in the midpoint of your operating income in 3Q. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Scott, we gave guidance of 215 to 305 from a CSOI perspective, which is implied -- operating margin of 4.5% to 5.8%. So from the upper end of the guidance, at 5.8%, that's about 40 basis points above last year. And so, again, that reflects the right range for the quarter.

One thing to keep in mind, though, is as you look at Q2 to Q3 -- those numbers I was just talking about was the absolute and then comparing them year-over-year -- when you look at sequentially from Q2 to Q3, keep in mind that Q3 historically is a quarter that we're getting ready for our largest seasonal quarter, Q4. And so there's certainly expenses that are included in that quarter to get ready for, for example, adding additional capacity.

And certainly with the growth that we've seen, particularly in international, we are adding capacity to get ready for Q4. So that's reflected in our Q3 guidance. And it's typical at this time [to that] based on getting ready for Q4. So again, that's why you saw -- one of the reasons why you saw a decline last year as well.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great. Thanks for taking the question. It looks like your sales and marketing costs picked up a little bit as a percentage of revenue, both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. Could you talk about what's going on behind that? And also if you could just discuss your effective tax rate. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. From a marketing perspective, it was 2.7% of revenue. The range over the past several quarters have been in the low 2's -- 2.2%, I believe, to 2.7%. So it was a little bit on the higher end of the range. But again, I wouldn't read too much into that. It's just based on the opportunities that we saw within the quarter, looking at new customer acquisitions. So again, I don't think there's anything really meaningful to talk about there.

In terms of effective tax rate, the way I'm thinking about it is if you look at the effective tax rate for the half, it's a little bit over 25%. Keep in mind that we had a one-time item, Toys 'R' Us, which was $51 million; substantially all of that would be in that number, which is tax affected at the US tax rate. So that's bringing it down a bit. It's a one-time event. So if you back that out, the tax rate would be a little bit higher than that, which would reflect essentially the projection for the year.

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JPMorgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions -- I think in the past, you talked about how you are not seeing cannibalization from Kindle. I think you talked about like how average Kindle owners are buying 1.8 books. Can you give us an update on that number? What kind of trend you're seeing now that you have a larger Kindle owner.

And secondly, I think, Tom, you talked about that you're seeing healthy growth in the third-party international business, but international gross profit margins, I believe, was down on a year-over-year basis, roughly 50 basis points. So could you give us some color to understand that, why? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. I'll take the third-party first, for International.

What you're seeing there is we are actually -- we did actually see very good third-party growth in International. One thing to keep in mind as we look at our overall growth rates in international, we saw extremely strong EGM growth accelerated to 60% year-over-year on a local currency basis.

Many of those categories, if you look back over the past few years, we've launched a number of new categories in EGM and international. And when we launch new categories, oftentimes the gross margins are lower, again, as we're starting out in those categories. So that's reflecting the product mix.

But if you look at our overall International gross margins, we certainly saw strong third-party growth -- very good vendor management, very good inventory management -- but certainly partially offset by the mix that I'm talking about as well as lower prices for customers.

In terms of the Kindle units, we're not doing any updates in terms of the units, in terms of specific numbers today. But we're seeing very, very good growth and we're extremely happy with the growth that we're seeing there, and it's exceeding our expectations.

OPERATOR: Gene Munster, Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.: There's been a lot of talk about that tax rate and some third-party affiliates and the impact, and some of the jockeying around where taxes ultimately go in terms of sales tax. Can you give us how just generally you think about the sales tax question over the next several years?

TOM SZKUTAK: It's one of these where we've been working for quite a few years with the states just on the streamlined sales tax act. Beyond that, it's really hard to comment on what will happen going forward.

I think it's important to remember that more than 50% of our business is conducted in areas where consumption tax, the VAT tax through the equivalent of sales tax, are taking place are international geographies. And we now collect sales taxes in five states in the United States. So, we have very strong businesses in our international business, as you can see from today's results.

GENE MUNSTER: Okay. So do you think ultimately that sales tax will be part of -- as a 100% of sales in the next five years, say?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes -- you can't speculate what will happen going forward.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, BAS-ML: A couple of things. First, on the media sales decline. When you think longer-term, do you think you might see some pressure on revenues, but the overall gross margins per unit hang in there because of digitization? And could you actually see a margin improvement offset maybe lower prices for in-sales?

And then secondly, tech and content looks like it ticked up $24 million quarter-over-quarter. Wonder if you had any comments you could share with us on maybe where you're allocating that money. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: You know, the way I think about the gross margins for our digital businesses, if you look at our overall digital business, it's very early. Think of it that we're investing, in the investing mode. And over time, we think that we can get very good returns for shareholders. And we think that there's a lot of room for us and content owners and publishers to do well there. We think that those are -- that we'll get good returns over time.

In terms of tech and content, there's a number of things that are going in there. You can see from our employment numbers that the growth is approximately 14% year-over-year. It slowed from past quarters, but we did still see a sequential increase of about 400 people. Some of those people are certainly going to tech and content, investing in areas like digital and Web services and other areas, which is certainly -- are reflected in the tech and content costs.

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth, Barclays.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thanks for taking my question. Tom, can you comment on the unearned revenues line? And in particular, it looks like you've had a very good, consistent trend there over the last several quarters, which I believe is probably fueled by Prime and the Kindle. And you said that you're pretty comfortable with where both of those products are; but basically, we're seeing from 1Q to 2Q, a flat number in unearned revenue. So if you could provide some clarity on that, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, there is a number of things that go in there, including the items that you mentioned. We do amortize the sale of Kindles over two years in the month following the sale.

We are amortizing the Prime subscriptions. There's also other partner relationships, revenues that go into that line -- some amortization. And beyond that, it does bounce around a bit, as you see from the trend. But beyond that, there's not a lot I can add from a [call-up] perspective.

DOUG ANMUTH: But you mentioned earlier just that you were -- that Prime growth was pretty good. I mean, is there any reason to think that there's any slowdown here in terms of new members coming onboard?

TOM SZKUTAK: No. No, in fact, Prime growth is very strong. And obviously, from our other discussions, Kindle growth is very strong. So, no, we're seeing strong growth in both areas.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Jefferies & Company.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Two quick questions, Tom. You've lowered prices on Kindle, on Kindle 2. How should we be thinking about the driving force there? Did you get enough cost scale to still keep margins relatively unchanged? Or did you lower price really to just increase penetration?

And secondarily, on the affiliate question, as you pulled back out of certain states -- so, I think North Carolina, Rhode Island, and a few others -- are you using other affiliates in other states? Or are you moving some of that money to other ROI channels, like Search, et cetera? And which one has better ROI? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we use a number of different channels on the marketing side. And we're just looking at what's the most effective way to make that spend and where do we think it drives incremental value to shareholders over time. And so that's not something new.

There's no change there from that perspective. And we use a number of different channels. From a pay channel perspective, we also have our Associates channel as well. So there's not a lot new there from that perspective.

And then your other question -- in terms of Kindle (multiple speakers) -- price change, we certainly are getting better economies, and given the growth in Kindle devices, and we think that that's an appropriate price for customers. And we think that it's certainly helpful, given the growth that we're seeing.

OPERATOR: Jeffrey Lindsay, Sanford Bernstein.

JEFFREY LINDSAY, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: Thanks for taking my question. Two things -- could we ask -- could you give us any sense of whether Zappos is going to be dilutive or accretive to earnings? And could you give us a sense of the post-merger integration planning for that acquisition? And how we should think about it going forward, particularly if it is going to be dilutive to earnings?

And then second, could you tell us have you any plans to take Kindle overseas? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of Zappos, we're extremely pleased with the announcement that we made yesterday. And we're not discussing the dilutive or accretive nature of Zappos.

I guess the way you should think about it is this -- they had approximately $635 million worth of revenue last year. They had a small profit. And that would certainly be before any of the acquisition costs, which include intangible amortization as well as stock-based compensation, which would be post-acquisition.

But we're -- in terms of integration, the way you should think about it is it's going to be a standalone business. We're very, very excited about the value that they bring to customers. It's very unique. We're very excited about helping that team build brand. And we think it's a unique brand and culture, and this will be a great fit with Amazon.

We think that we can grow -- it's a great way to grow our overall shoe and apparel business. So we're very excited about it. And we've got a great team there -- overall team; a great leadership team. And we're extremely happy to be able to make the announcement yesterday.

JEFFREY LINDSAY: And then in terms of (multiple speakers) -- are you taking it overseas?

TOM SZKUTAK: The last part? (multiple speakers) International. In terms of Kindle International, it's certainly an opportunity. Our customers have certainly expressed it's an interest. And we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we might do, but certainly, it's clearly an opportunity.

OPERATOR: Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Just have a follow up question regarding Zappos. Tom, could you just talk a little bit more about just the strategic rationale behind Zappos? Leaving it as an independent brand and company, it's a little bit of a departure, I think, in terms of how you've historically grown your business under the Amazon brand.

And then secondarily, as part of that, even though it's going to be an independent unit within Amazon, are there any cost savings that we should be expecting from a -- maybe a Fulfillment perspective? Any clarity on that would be great. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: It's -- actually, the way we're thinking about it is this -- we have Zappos and 6pm, which will join us. We have shopbop; we have Endless; and we certainly have Amazon.com -- all selling in softlines, in shoes and apparel. So we're very, very excited to have all those websites with -- if you take a look at those websites, they have many different brands. They have different customers. They have a different customer experience associated with each of them.

So we're very excited to have all those. And from our standpoint, we're looking to learn from each other. And we think that those categories are very interesting. And we think there's a lot of growth opportunity, and that's why we're doing that.

So this is not an acquisition that we're talking about -- you mentioned synergies; certainly, we'll be smart about it. If there's fulfillment centers that -- a fulfillment center that they have, if they have additional space, we'll certainly look to use that. Or if we have additional space that Zappos can use, we certainly will look at those opportunities.

But this is not about synergies. This is about growing in categories that we think are very interesting. And so we're very excited about it.

I'd also add that this really isn't that much of a departure at all -- or is not a departure at all. We've done a number of acquisitions over time -- shopbop, as I mentioned, is one of those; is an acquisition we did about three years ago, in the same similar categories, certainly in the softlines. It's more of an apparel -- fashion for women's apparel and shoes website and accessories.

And so we've also done a number of acquisitions; as we look at some of our country launches -- the last one was joyo.com, was our launch in China. So again, we've done a number of these. Our strategy, as it relates to acquisitions, hasn't changed; it's the same it's been for several years now. And again, we saw it was a great fit and we're really pleased to be able to make the announcement yesterday.

OPERATOR: Sandeep Aggarwal, Collins Stewart.

SANDEEP AGGARWAL, ANALYST, COLLINS STEWART: Thanks for taking my question. Tom, as eBay continues to transform its marketplace, what does that mean for Amazon?

I know you already talked about Prime membership doing very well, but, I guess, are you seeing any signs of weakness in the new enrollment of Prime membership or any visible changes in the growth of third-party merchant enrollment?

TOM SZKUTAK: We have a long-standing practice of not talking about other companies; but in terms of our seller business, we had our -- as I mentioned, third-party units were 30% -- percentage of total units, which is up over last year.

Our sellers grew 21%, which is the fastest growth rate we've seen. In Q2, it's the fastest growth rate we've seen in many quarters. And our seller team has continued to focus on how to make it, that customer experience for our sellers, as good as it possibly can be.

FBA is an example of that. It's a great example where we provide services for sellers. It's great for customers, because they get to get sellers the use of our multi-node fulfillment network, which allows them to get shipments using our Super-Saver Shipping and Prime programs.

And so, again, our seller team is continuously focused on trying to make that experience better. And that's reflected in the metrics that you saw today that I mentioned, as well as the gross profit growth that we mentioned earlier as well.

OPERATOR: Ben Schachter, Broadpoint AmTech.

BEN SCHACHTER, ANALYST, BROADPOINT AMTECH: I was wondering if you could discuss the private label that you're creating for some products and just discuss the strategic value there, and any issues that that may bring up with some of the 3P partners. And then also any update you may have on your used videogame efforts. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: You know, we experiment in a number of different areas. And we do have a small amount of private label product. I don't think there's a lot to talk to, but again, there's -- we're certainly doing some. And we'll see what traction we get there.

In the used videogame, that's something -- certainly it's one of the things -- when you look at our total customer experience for video games, the team, again, as I mentioned, has done a great job of improving the customer experience over the past few years. And that's just another example of one of the things that they've done.

OPERATOR: Jim Friedland, Cowen and Company.

JIM FRIEDLAND, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Looking at the other line in North America sequentially, it showed some pretty good growth. And I was wondering, did that come from any of the cloud computing services? Are you seeing momentum there? Or is that driven by marketing fees or something in that area?

TOM SZKUTAK: There's a number of things that are going on there, but certainly, our Web services business is growing very nicely for us. And that's reflected in those numbers.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, FBR Capital Markets.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, FRIEDMAN, BILLINGS, RAMSEY GROUP, INC.: You just mentioned that the Web services business is growing nicely. Can you give us an idea of which, if any, if there are any specific segments of the Web services business that are performing particularly well? And when -- looking at those on a standalone basis, where would you suggest we focus in terms of which ones you feel like have the most potential long-term to really contribute?

ROB ELDRIDGE: It's Rob here, Heath. How are you doing? (multiple speakers) We don't go down into specific service-related financials in this market, as you well know. But we're very, very happy with EC2, S3, Simple Database, the entire suite of services. And we've been in the market now for three-plus years with our paying customers, trying to deliver reliable, scalable, fast, flexible, responsive solutions to our developer base. And we're going to continue to go do that.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com first-quarter 2009 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.

For opening remarks, I will now be turning the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.

   TD
ROB ELDRIDGE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q1 '09 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 23, 2009, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008.

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Rob. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 82% to $1.43 billion. Return on invested capital was 41%, up from 32%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.

The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 447 million shares compared with 435 million.

Worldwide revenue grew 18% to $4.89 billion or 25% excluding the $268 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.

Media revenue increased to $2.72 billion, up 7%, or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $2.05 billion, up 38%, or 46% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 42% of worldwide sales, up from 36%. Worldwide unit growth was 30%. Active customer accounts exceeded 91 million, up 16%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $1.6 million, up 19%. Seller units were 32% of total units versus 30%.

Worldwide gross profit was $1.15 billion, up 20%.

Now we will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $826 million or 16.9% of sales, unchanged year over year. Fulfillment was $407 million or 8.3% of revenue, while tech and content was $239 million or 4.9% of revenue. Both were unchanged from the prior year. Marketing was $124 million or 2.5% of revenue, up 11 basis points from the prior year.

Now I will talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense (income), net line item.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $2.58 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $1.31 billion. EGM grew 42% to $1.17 billion, representing 45% of North America revenues, up from 39%. North America gross profit grew 22% to $694 million, and gross margin increased 18 basis points to 26.9%, driven by improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and the increase in the 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.

North America segment operating income increased 15% to $150 million, a 5.8% operating margin.

In the international segment, revenue grew 15% to $2.31 billion. Revenue growth was 28%, adjusting for the $258 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 6% to $1.42 billion or 17% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 34% to $874 million or 50% excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.

EGM now represents 38% of international revenues, up from 33%.

International gross profit grew 17% to $454 million or grew 33% excluding foreign exchange rates, while gross margin increased 36 basis points to 19.6%, driven by improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing, and increases in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.

International segment operating income increased 34% to $172 million, a 7.4% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from FX, international segment operating income increased 63%. CSOI grew 25% to $322 million or 6.6% of revenue, up 33 basis points year over year. Excluding the $32 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 37%.

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense/income. GAAP operating income grew 23% to $244 million or 5% of net sales.

Our income tax expense was $69 million in Q1 or a 28% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $177 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with $143 million and $0.34 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $579 million year over year to $2.73 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA-rated money market funds and other investment-grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value.

During the quarter, we redeemed the remaining EUR240 million, $319 million based on the euro to US dollar exchange rate at the date of redemption and principal, of our 6.875% peaks.

Inventory increased 18% to $1.27 billion and inventory turns were 12.5, down 0.5 turns from the prior year, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.

Accounts payable increased 28% to $2.38 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 57 from 53 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $295 million from a year ago to $889 million. Our Q1 2009 capital expenditures were $55 million.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainties surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.

It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.

Our guidance assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q2, we expect net sales of between $4.3 billion and $4.75 billion, or growth between 6% and 17%. This guidance anticipates approximately 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange.

GAAP operating income to be between $110 million and $190 million or a decline between 49% and 12%. The second-quarter 2008 results include the $53 million noncash gain recognized on the sale of the Company's European DVD rental assets. This includes approximately $90 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $200 million and $280 million or between 18% decline and 14% growth. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability, including some changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Doug Anmuth, Barclays Capital.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Great quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about the 2Q guidance? And in particular, is there something that you're seeing early in the quarter that is making the outlook look a little bit lower than we would have expected versus the 1Q numbers, particularly on the margin side? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Our guidance from a revenue standpoint is growth of 6% to 17%. That's on a dollar basis. On a local currency basis, that works out to be 13% to 24%. A few things to keep in mind. One, last year, Q2 was our strongest growth quarter. So if you take a look at the splits by quarter, last year we had 41% growth rate in Q2, or 35% growth rate on a local currency basis, or overlapping that growth rate, again, the strongest quarter.

A couple other things to keep in mind on the top line as well, smaller impacts, but certainly Easter was in Q1 last year. It was in Q2 this year. So we had that benefit in Q1, and we will be overlapping that in Q2. Also, as I mentioned, from an exchange standpoint, the 700 basis points is more than we saw in Q1. So again, those are the impacts from the top line.

So that is why the high end of the range, if you will, works out to be 24%, which is a little bit lower than we came in for Q1. So that translates down into, obviously, a lower operating income. The other thing to keep in mind, too, is as you look at our Q2, seasonally Q2 is our lowest quarter from a revenue perspective, which means with that top line, you get a little bit less leverage in particularly the fixed operating costs. So that is reflected in the guidance.

OPERATOR: James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great. Thank you for taking the question, which is about the improvement in gross margin year on year in the first quarter. Were there any unusual gross margin influences other than our old friends, inventory management and third-party mix, EGM mix and lower prices?

TOM SZKUTAK: No. Those are the big pieces. Certainly inventory management, we worked well with vendors in terms of getting vendor savings. An example would be something we have been working on for a number of quarters, but certainly working with them to ship when they have shipments to ship in bulk to the nearest fulfillment center. The benefit of that is they get -- this is a way to share some of those savings of them shipping to the closest facility, and then we get to optimize taking that larger bulk shipment and optimizing that in our network. So things like that, but certainly inventory management, vendor savings and also third-party growth were certainly key factors. And those were partially offset by lower prices to customers.

JAMES MITCHELL: Are digital sales an impact or not?

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, digital sales, as you can -- you are referring to Kindle sales or all digital or--? I mean, digital is certainly part of the numbers. Keep in mind as you think about Kindle specifically from a device standpoint, we recognize that in the month following shipment over a two-year period. We amortize that over a two-year period.

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Two questions. First of all, it's probably hard to break out, but I guess maybe a qualitative view. But I'm just curious how much of your core infrastructure that you have been building over the last couple years is being redeployed in other business initiatives, such as FBA and AWS, that are maybe contributing to the operating profit line. I guess is there any way to quantify that, what the contribution looks like to CSOI, at the end of the day, some of your newer initiatives in terms of leveraging the fixed assets and costs that you've built out over the years?

Second question is, I guess, can you characterize how much downsizing and retrenching that online and offline retailers are doing out there in the landscape is impacting your business positively or in general as it relates to as you kind of go after customers or consumers, as well as just talking to your suppliers? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: The first part of your question, just to maybe talk to how we think about the overall infrastructure, both from an operations as well as infrastructure capacity standpoint, the retail part of our business, you know, we plan for peak. And so when you think about, say, fulfillment capacity, we are certainly planning for peak, which, again, is in December. Our infrastructure capacity that supports our retail business, we also plan for peak as well.

And so some of the things that you are seeing with FBA, as well as Web Services, we are not looking at it as a way to use our existing infrastructure. We are looking at them as separate, separately standing businesses, if you will. And we look at the economics that way as well.

So I don't know if that is helpful. So it is hard to tease apart -- to answer your question. And then the second part, could you repeat the second part of the question, Jeetil? Sorry.

JEETIL PATEL: (technical difficulty) is having for you guys in terms of talking to consumers and talking to your suppliers?

TOM SZKUTAK: Could you repeat that? I apologize. I couldn't hear you.

JEETIL PATEL: Yes, just trying to understand whether online and offline retailers, as they shrink their business, kind of grow spending out there, how much of an impact is that having or opportunity is that as you go after customers, as well as go after better supplier terms out there?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, I apologize. I don't think I can help you much with that one. I would just add to the first one that we use the same -- so, for example, with Fulfillment by Amazon, the Fulfillment by Amazon inventory is commingled with our Amazon-owned inventory in the same fulfillment centers. So in that respect, we're leveraging those fixed investments. But we are not -- there's not excess capacity that we can -- we are building new capacity, both for Amazon-owned inventory and new capacity for FBA. But it is commingled inventory.

Same thing for Web Services. When you look at our data centers, the Amazon Retail Services and the Web Services that we offer through infrastructure computing like EC2 and S3, those are commingled in the same data centers as well. So there you go.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citi.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Jeff, in your shareholder letter you refer to muda, or waste, a Japanese word for waste. And you talk about being able to -- seeing it in a lot of different places and a lot of potential. Could you maybe bring it down to financial terms for us? And where do you think you have your best opportunity to get at that waste and where we would see it maybe show up, or are we already seeing it in terms of some of those CapEx efficiencies? CapEx spending seems to be nicely contained.

And then secondly, just on marketing spend, is there any particular reason why you're not seeing a little bit more efficiency in marketing spend, given what seems to be pretty clear deflationary trends in online display or search advertising? Thank you very much.

JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT, CEO AND CHAIRMAN, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Well, on the muda point, this is very encouraging for me and very energizing for me that everywhere we look, and every team here looks, when we look we find that we are doing every operation that we do in suboptimal ways. We have gotten better every year, but we still have a lot of progress that we can make. And that is encouraging, because it means we can get variable, we believe, we can get variable and fixed productivity for a long time to come.

So that is the opportunity. I don't know how to quantify that for you. We do have, every time we go through our planning process, we do set top-down targets for variable and fixed productivity, and we try to work towards those, make sure that we're being frugal and efficient so that we can have a cost structure that supports the customer experience we want to have, which is to have the lowest prices. So that is something we take very seriously, and as I said, very, very energizing for me to see how much opportunity there is there.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: A couple. Some people measure Google's paid clicks versus revenues as a measure of the recession impact. If I look at your revenues versus your units, 30% units, 25% revenues, is that 5% related to maybe ASPs, or is there a mix issue or shift going on?

And then two quick ones. Your shipping revenue was down 1% year over year. Does that have any indication on Prime adoption? And then the other revenue in the US, the growth slowed there. Were there some interesting things going on last year that maybe have stopped, and can we read anything into your Web Services adoption based on that number? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: From a mix standpoint, the one thing that we are seeing certainly is higher-priced items are still growing, but certainly not growing as much as they were a few quarters ago. So that is really one of the impacts that you are seeing. Keep in mind when you look at our -- our business, given the selection that we have and the categories that we are in, you do see certainly some variation by quarter in terms of mix, just because the sheer amount of the selection that we have.

In terms of the shipping revenue, there is no question that we are seeing a good adoption in Prime, and it certainly -- and free shipping, and that is certainly impacting that revenue line item. That is a trend that you have been seeing, if you look back to prior quarters, that's something you have been seeing for awhile.

In terms of your last portion of the revenues, there is a number of things that goes in that line item, and as we have talked about in previous calls, that can tend to be a little lumpy from quarter to quarter. But again, there's a large number of things that go in there, as we've described in other quarters.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: I just wanted to touch on vendor pricing again, if I could, and ask it a different way. I was wondering if you were seeing any significant differences by category possibly in areas where there's more significant retail disruption. And then also, if you could just comment on the sustainability of these vendor pricing improvements in all economic environments. I think, Tom, you mentioned getting product to different fulfillment centers. Does that seem sustainable? And I'm interested if, as well, if there's vendor pricing that is just driven by the general disruption in the channel and whether the relevance of the business model can sustain that as the economy improves. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: I apologize. There's not a lot of help I can give you on the vendor pricing side. We continue to work with our partners in all of the categories that we are in geographically. Certainly the way you should think about it is, we think that there is room over time to work with our partners to get better prices over the long term. Certainly the categories that we have been in the longest, there's still opportunities. But when you think about magnitude in terms of basis points, I would think that there would be more opportunity in the categories that we have been in the shortest amount of time. That is the way I would think about it.

In terms of what it could look like going forward, we certainly had a healthy amount of savings in Q1, as reflected in the gross margins that you see. And what we believe is certainly reflected in our Q2 guidance. But we will continue to work over certainly a long period of time to continue to try to get better, work better with suppliers to get better savings.

OPERATOR: Jeffrey Lindsay, Sanford Bernstein.

JEFFREY LINDSAY, ANALYST, SANFORD BERNSTEIN: Could I ask two questions? First, did you have a specific push on Fulfillment by Amazon, or was that demand-driven? And then could you give us just an indication on margins on that business and where you are booking it exactly? Is it all going into other, or is it spread across the product categories?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of FBA, this is something that we have been doing for not long. But it's, again, over the last several quarters, and it has continued to build. I wouldn't call it any specific push. It's certainly something that we are offering to sellers. We think it is a very good experience for sellers so that they can take advantage of our multinode fulfillment network in the US and our fulfillment networks outside of the US.

So we think that that is a great opportunity. It comes in a number of different forms in terms of the revenue. Certainly the third-party revenue that you're seeing would come in the individual categories, which is certainly the largest piece. And obviously, we are recording the operating expense associated with those fulfillment services in our fulfillment line item.

JEFF BEZOS: I think I will add to that just to say that one of the things that is driving the uptake of Fulfillment by Amazon is that sellers have the opportunity to drive up their sales when they switch to Fulfillment by Amazon, in large part because of the interaction between Fulfillment by Amazon and Amazon Prime. So as soon as a seller switches to using Fulfillment by Amazon, all of their products become eligible for Amazon Prime just as if they were Amazon-owned items. So the interaction between those two programs is driving sales for sellers. And that is something, of course, that sellers want. I think that is, in large part, what is driving the uptake of Fulfillment by Amazon.

OPERATOR: Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDUT SUISSE: Wondering about the media line. That has been decelerating. Is there anything -- I know FX has impacted the international part. Is there anything going on there beyond just the maturation of the category?

Then on a related matter, as media as a category transitions to digital, could you, Jeff, maybe talk about Amazon VOD and how you plan on differentiating that going forward? Thanks.

JEFF BEZOS: If you take a look at our -- you mentioned the international media, I think was the first part. (multiple speakers) growth in general. We saw -- in North America, we saw an 8% growth, which is consistent with what we saw in Q4. Q4 was just slightly less than that, plus 7%. And then in international, on a local currency basis, it was up 17%, which was down a little bit from Q3. It was 22%.

And again, you saw our total revenue. If you go back to Q4 for international, it was 31% on a local currency basis. And so it was really consistent with what we saw in the first -- really the first three quarters of the year. We saw that dip a little bit, and we believe that is economic-related in Q1, to 28%, but still very solid growth. 28% in total for our international businesses on a local currency basis. So we did see a little bit of decline in international media, but we saw a corresponding increase in EGM also, growing 50% on a local currency basis.

JEFF BEZOS: The Amazon Video On Demand team is doing a terrific job. The strategy is very simple, which is to keep improving the customer experience of Video On Demand relentlessly as we go forward, and at the same time, to make it very, very easy for partners to integrate the Video On Demand service into their set-top box or video display device.

So, today, you can use Video On Demand, very -- Amazon Video On Demand very seamlessly on TiVo and also on the Roku box. So continuing to do those kinds of integrations is an important part of the strategy in making those integrations easy for our partners.

OPERATOR: Sandeep Aggarwal, Collins Stewart.

SANDEEP AGGARWAL, ANALYST, COLLINS STEWART: Jeff, one question on -- obviously, Kindle -- both generation one and generation two of Kindle did very well. Any plan to unleash the computing power of Kindle and let it compete with form factors like netbook, which are obviously gaining better traction now?

JEFF BEZOS: We are really focused on purpose-built reading devices. And so we wouldn't talk anyway about what we might do in the future. But I can tell you that we're really focused on devices with electronic ink displays that are purpose-built for reading. Kindle 2 really is a terrific long-form reading device. And we think reading is an important enough activity that it deserves a purpose-built device, and that is really a sweet spot for us.

OPERATOR: Marianne Wolk, Susquehanna.

MARIANNE WOLK, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP: I had a couple of quick questions. First, can you update us on your cloud computing business and any initiatives with larger corporate accounts you've been successful with? Also, in the past you disclosed the number of web developers in your solution as nearly 400,000. Can you provide any update to that figure?

And then finally, you reduced capacity earlier this quarter, which appeared minor, and headcount fell by about 100 sequentially. Can you comment whether these are cost control efforts and describe any other specific cost reduction initiatives in place that are helping margins? Thanks a lot.

JEFF BEZOS: I will take the first one. Examples of enterprise customers using our infrastructure Web services today, there are many, but I will name a few -- Eli Lilly doing basic research, clinical trial analysis using EC2. ESPN is another user of EC2. Autodesk is a user of EC2. There are many more. Some of them prefer not to be identified for competitive reasons. There are a number of hedge funds using EC2 for compute. So I will just leave it at that. But there is good traction in the enterprise customer set, as well, of course, there is with startups, small business and medium business.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of your other question related to headcount, it was pretty flat. Q1 headcount was pretty flat with year end. We did continue to hire, but we also had attrition as well. So it just remained pretty flat.

In terms of other productivity, we have a large number of things that we are working on from a productivity standpoint. I talked about some of them earlier. We continue to work with suppliers to find ways where we can make them more successful, as well as us more successful.

One of the ways that we -- like Jeff talked about some of the efforts we have earlier, in Mark's question. And one of the ways that we spent a lot of time on is -- to get productivity is by becoming more efficient for customers. And we find that the many, many programs that we have to become more efficient for customers translates into a better experience for customers, but it also results in productivity. So we have many, many different programs across the Company. This is not something new. This is something that we've been working on for quite a few years. And as Jeff described earlier, we have a lot of opportunities to continue to work on those going forward as well.

OPERATOR: Youssef Squali, Jefferies & Co.

YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO.: Two quick ones. First, starting with Tom, if I look at the segment breakouts and I look at your electronics and other in the US, there was a noticeable reacceleration in that business. Growth was at 42%. Can you just help us understand why the acceleration? Were there any subcategories that performed exceptionally well or better than your expectations?

And then, Jeff, back to the Amazon VOD, a question -- what would be the hurdles to maybe allowing Amazon to move into a subscription model and in addition to the a la carte offering that you already have? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of electronics and other general merchandise, we did see strong growth in North America. We also saw strong growth in international. And it was -- we continue to add selection in those categories. We continue to improve our in-stock levels, so that when customers came to our detail pages to order it was available right away for shipment. So a lot of -- and pricing was very, very competitive. So we think the combination of certainly prices, adding additional selection, in-stocks and certainly fast delivery with Prime helping those numbers as well.

JEFF BEZOS: In answer to the Video On Demand subscription model, there is nothing structural that would prohibit that. The amount of selection that you have available in a subscription model today is much less than what you can get with the a la carte model. So that is the beginnings of an answer to your question, I think.

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, Lazard.

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, LAZARD CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to get your perspective on some of the regional and national initiatives to impose sales taxation on the Internet, for example what you might expect to see in terms of any impact on demand perhaps from an historical perspective.

TOM SZKUTAK: You know, it's hard to say. There's not a lot I can help you with there.

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JPMorgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. First, I think some of the retail companies and some online retailers also talked about business condition stabilization or improving. Now, your business was not impacted that much by the economy, but can you give us some sense -- have you seen some sign of improvement or growth rate acceleration as we progress towards the end of the quarter?

And second question is for Jeff. Jeff, third-party business is growing at a faster pace and becoming a bigger part of the business. The challenge is, I think you are very extremely focused on improving user experience. As third-party becomes a bigger part of the business, how closely are you monitoring the user -- consumer satisfaction, and how do you guarantee that the consumer gets the same satisfaction when they buy from Amazon when Amazon is the principal? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, in terms of growth rate, it is obviously difficult to say what the economic impact is. But we certainly, starting in Q4, looking at our overall growth rates, we saw solid growth rates, but certainly not as strong as we saw for the several quarters previous to that. And you saw the same thing again in Q1. So our Q1 revenue growth was 25% on a local currency basis. But last year, in the first three quarters, it was well into the 30s.

And so we did see some slowdown both in Q4 and Q1. But we continue -- we are not doing anything different than we have done in the past. We're continuing to focus on what we think are the right things for customers. And that's what we are doing. So it's hard to say what the economic impact is.

JEFF BEZOS: On the third-party sales business question, how do we guarantee the customer experience in a third-party model, there are a couple of ways. One, we maintain scorecards on the sellers. And the sellers are very interested in self-improvement. The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of sellers do a very good job fulfilling for customers. And the small fraction that do not, we can provide them feedback and we can ultimately ask them not to sell on Amazon.

The second thing we do is we have the A-to-z Guarantee. So ultimately, we can take care of customers if the seller cannot.

And then third, we have Fulfillment by Amazon. So Fulfillment by Amazon really levels the experience and makes it so that those third-party-sold items have exactly the same fulfillment and customer service experience as Amazon-owned inventory.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, FBR Capital Markets.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS: You mentioned that third-party this quarter was 32%. That is a number that has been surprisingly stable for awhile, and particularly surprising, given the growth that you are obviously seeing to some degree in third-party in Europe. Can you give us a sense of where you feel like the right balance for that is? And I guess to the extent that you are willing to talk about the difference in where you are with third-party as a percent of your units in the US or as a percentage of quarters in the US versus Europe, at what level do you see that balancing out?

JEFF BEZOS: You know, ultimately the customer is going to decide what that mix ends up being. And what we are trying to do is trying to make sure that we have a great customer experience certainly for our consumers. We continue to work as well on our sellers, which is another customer set that we have.

And so the way you should think about it is we're trying to make those two experiences -- as well as our third customer set, which is developers -- but in terms of mix, the customer is going to ultimately decide. And what we're trying to do is just make that experience as good as we can make it so that the customers will ultimately decide who they buy from.

In terms of the -- we haven't disclosed what the numbers are for each of the two segments. But looking at Q1, both segments are growing nicely.

OPERATOR: Jim Friedland, Cowen and Company.

JIM FRIEDLAND, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: I was wondering if you could give us any color on what is going on with the asset in China in terms of how big is it at this point, or if you can give us some sort of comparison as to what it would look like compared to when Amazon was young. When did it become a material part of the business? Thanks.

JEFF BEZOS: We haven't split out the specific geography numbers. But we are very pleased with the business we have in China. It is growing nicely, and we think that's an interesting long-term opportunity for us.

OPERATOR: Gene Munster, Piper Jaffray.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: If you can talk a little bit about Prime and just the overall percentage of products on Prime right now. I know you talked about Fulfillment by Amazon. And how do you basically fulfill and promote more products being offered by Prime?

And the second is, can you talk a little bit about just behavior when people actually do sign up for Prime, just general differences in how people's buying behavior changes once they become Prime?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of selection, we have very vast selection in Prime. And so it is just a very good experience for customers, and we continue to add to that selection. We continued to add selection to that in Q1; we will continue to add selection in the coming quarters for our Prime customers.

In terms of the experience, what we are seeing, we are seeing customers are doing a lot more cross-shopping than they have previously. And so it is a very good experience for customers. It's certainly impacting the growth rates that you're seeing, not only this quarter, but the last several quarters. So it is a very good experience for customers.

JEFF BEZOS: I would just add, when Tom talks about Prime selection growing, it is millions of different items, and it is across all categories. So you can use your Prime membership to buy shoes, to buy food, to buy diapers, to buy obviously media products and electronics and so on. But it's across a wide array of categories and growing every day.

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. (Operating Instructions). Today's call is being recorded, and for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.

ROB ELDRIDGE, VP, IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 '08 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. The following discussion in response to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 29, 2009 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC. Including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

   TD
As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our result for the comparable period of 2007. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Rob. Let me start by reviewing our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing twelve-month free cash flow grew 16% to $1.36 billion. Return on invested capital is 41%, down from 55%. RIOC is trailing twelve-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 446 million shares compared with 435 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 18% to $6.7 billion or 24%, excluding the $320 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $3.64 billion up 9%, or 15% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $2.89 billion up 31%, or 36% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 43% of worldwide sales, up from 39%. Worldwide unit growth was 28%.

Active customer accounts exceeded 88 million, up 16%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.5 million, up 18%. Sellers units were 27% of total units, versus 26%. Worldwide gross profit was $1.35 billion, up 15%.

Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $989 million, or 14.7% of sales down 9 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $530 million or 7.9% of revenue, compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $236 million or 3.5% of revenue, compared with 3.4%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense income, net line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 18% to $3.63 billion. Media revenue grew 7% to $1.75 billion. EGM revenue grew 30% to $1.73 billion, representing 48% of North America revenues, up from 43%.

We were particularly pleased with Kindle demand during the fourth quarter. We want to remind everyone that Kindle revenue and costs are recognized over a two-year period. The Kindle store contains the largest collection of eBooks available anywhere in the world. Selection increased by 45,000 titles in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to 230,000 titles. 103 out of 112 current "New York Times" best sellers are available and along with most new releases are priced at $9.99 or less. In addition, the Kindle store recently added the Arizona Republic, Baltimore Sun, Orange County Register, and USA Today and now offers newspapers from eight of the top ten Metro areas in the United States.

North America gross profit grew 12% to $781 million, and gross margin decreased 114 basis points to 21.5%, driven by lower prices for our customers, including free shipping offers in Amazon Prime and changes in product mix partially offset by higher other revenue. North America segment operating income declined 15% to $130 million, a 3.6% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 19% to $3.07 billion. Revenue growth was 31% adjusting for the $308 million year-over-year unfavorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 12% to $1.89 billion or 22%, excluding FX. And EGM grew 32% to $1.16 billion or 46%, excluding FX. EGM now represents 38% of international revenues, up from 34%.

International gross profit grew 20% to $567 million or grew 32%, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. While gross margin increased 23 basis points to 18.5%, driven by improvements in our vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales partially offset by lower prices to our customers and changes in product mixture. International segment operating income increased 31% to $229 million, a 7.4% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income increased 48%.

CSOI grew 9% to $359 million, or 5.4% of revenue down 44 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $26 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 17%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.

Income. GAAP operating income increased $1 million to $272 million, or 4.1% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $79 million in Q4, or 26% rate for the quarter. In 2008, we paid $53 million in cash taxes. A majority of our tax expense is non-cash because we have current tax benefits and NOLS related to excess stock-based compensation. GAAP net income was $225 million or $0.52 per diluted share compared with $207 million in $0.48 per diluted share.

Now, I'll discuss the full-year results. Revenue grew 29% to $19.17 billion, or 28%, excluding $127 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. North America revenue grew 26% to $10.23 billion, and international grew 33% to $8.94 billion, or 31% year-over-year growth, excluding the year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI grew 29% to $1.09 billion or 28%, excluding $10 million of favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin remained at 5.7%. GAAP operating income grew 28% to $842 million or 4.4% of net sales.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash marketable securities increased $615 million year-over-year to $3.73 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA-rated money market funds and other investment rate securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $100 million.

Inventory increased 17% to $1.4 billion, and inventory turns were 12.2, down one half turn from prior year as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels globally, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 29% to $3.59 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 62 from 57 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $311 million from a year ago to $854 million. Our 2008 capital expenditures were $333 million.

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as [market year-end] denominated debt to market quarterly, and to company balances in foreign currencies that settle amongst subsidiaries. Unfavorable resolutions of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q1, we expect net sales of between $4.5 billion to $5 billion and $4.9 billion to $5 billion of growth between 9% and 19%. This guidance anticipates approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $125 million and $210 million, or be between 37% decline and 6% growth. This includes approximately $75 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $200 million and $285 million, or between 23% decline and 10% growth. This guidance anticipates approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange.

We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate of trends similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability including some changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

OPERATOR: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question this afternoon will come from Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Hi, thanks and congratulations on the continued success. I have two questions, if I could. They are a little bit longer term in nature. First, I was wondering if you could just comment on the early progress of your large company-focused cloud computing initiative that you recently launched with Cap Gemini? And whether you think that you would pursue further initiatives or partnerships in that area to target enterprise level customers. And then secondly, on Amazon Video, which is now being distributed through several partners to get it toward the TV, and it's now a pay-per-view service. Could you just comment on what your long-term ambitions are in terms of a business model, potentially shifting from pay-per-view toward a subscription model as more digital content is available? Thanks.

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER & CEO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: I'll answer those. As far as the -- on the first question -- we think there is a very significant and meaningful opportunity over time for enterprise level customers with our web services business. This is the Elastic Compute Cloud and the Simple Storage Service are already being used by a number of enterprise level customers. And, we expect that trend to continue. On the business models for video, as you said, we have a pay-per-view model now. I just wouldn't want to speculate too much on what we might do in the future.

SCOTT DEVITT: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi. Your line is open.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Great. Thanks, Jeff, just on the Kindle. I know you are not disclosing a lot on it, but any major surprises from your perspective, maybe in terms of overall usage? Any cannibalization? Or do you just sense that overall it's just materially increased the overall book purchases of customers? And then, Tom, really quickly -- did you see material signs of discounting in the quarter? I assume you did, and just thoughts on how -- if your strategy for dealing with significant discounting in the marketplace was different this year than in prior years given the large third party base you have now? Thank you.

JEFF BEZOS: With Kindle sales, we see that when people buy a Kindle, they actually continue to buy the same number of physical books going forward as they did before they owned a Kindle. And then, incrementally, they buy about 1.6 to 1.7 electronic books, Kindle books, for every physical book that they buy. So so far what we're seeing is very strong incremental book unit sales, which of course, we're very pleased to see. The biggest surprises so far for Kindle has just been the unusually strong demand that we saw in the fourth quarter. We had anticipated strong demand and what we saw was stronger than that. So, we're extremely grateful for that, and we will keep marching forward here.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the second half your question, Mark, there's absolutely no change in strategy related to pricing. We're trying to make sure we offer a great value to customers. We operate in a very competitive marketplace, and certainly we saw that in Q4, which is reflected in the gross margins that you see and our Q4 results. So again, no change of strategy, and it was certainly very competitive. And that's reflected in the results that you see. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Jeff.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess I noticed that your additions to unearned revenue approximately doubled year-on-year despite Kindle's being out of stock most of the quarter. Could you speak to whether that reflects strong uptick of Prime or very heavy Kindle sales? The period when they weren't in stock and separately, it looks like your North American Media revenue growth decelerated quite sharply from 3Q to 4Q, whereas your international Media revenue growth, ex FX, was fairly stable in terms of year-on-year growth rates from 3Q to 4Q. I was wondering if that reflected purely macroeconomic motives or if there was anything else such as Harry Potter or video games driving that? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: The other revenue, in addition to the items that you mentioned, contains a number of things -- including Prime and our credit card relationships, and advertising, etcetera, and so we did see very solid growth there. In terms of your -- could you repeat the second half of your question, James? Sorry.

JAMES MITCHELL: Sure. It looks as if your North American Media growth decelerated from, I think, mid-teens year-on-year growth in the third quarter to 7% in the fourth quarter, whereas your international Media revenue growth remained at around 20% in both 3Q and 4Q, ex FX. I was wondering if there was anything kind of special behind the divergence in growth paths other than the US economy perhaps slowing more sharply?

TOM SZKUTAK: It wasn't just in Media , it was across the board. If you look at Media in EGM, we had stronger growth in international. We saw growth in total, ex exchange, of 31% in international, and we have -- we focus on the same thing we focus in North America -- on fundamentals -- making sure that we have great pricing. Certainly Prime is having an impact in international as well as North America, and offering just a great value proposition. Certainly, one thing to keep in mind when you look at international though -- we have launched, in addition to adding a lot of selection within existing categories, in all of our categories globally, we've launched approximately 25 categories over the past two years or so. And that certainly will have an impact on the growth rates

JAMES MITCHELL: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: Looks like a lot of offline retail stores are under some pressure, and there's a lot of store closures. Can you talk a little bit about anything you've seen in the music category historically from that? Has it helped you at all? And, how can you take advantage of some of that next year? Any competitive initiatives that might help the Company?

JEFF BEZOS: I think it's difficult to say what -- if any -- short-term impacts you might see from that. In the long-term, these are fortunately the markets that we operate in are very large markets, and there's room for lots of winners. So I don't think there's going to be much impact to the long-term, continue to be a very competitive environment.

OPERATOR: Mr. Post, any further questions?

JUSTIN POST: No, that's all. Thank you.

OPERATOR: We will move next to Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thanks for taking my questions. Can you tell me whether you've been impacted, or I guess whether you've been impacted at all since you've been -- since you've begun collecting taxes in New York in the middle part of the year? And then also, what are are you seeing in terms of new Prime memberships? Is there any kind of slowdown or deceleration in this type of macro environment? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of sales tax, we collect in certainly a number of states in the US, many jurisdictions outside of the US. In fact, approximately half of our business today that we are actually collecting, some type of either sales tax or value-added tax. And, we have very good businesses in those geographies, and so I can't comment much beyond that. In terms of Prime. We're very pleased with what we're seeing in Prime. We have very good subscriber growth, and customers like it. We certainly saw -- that was evidenced further in Q4 during the holiday season and reflected in the results that you see for Q4. So again, we're very pleased, and again it's something that we offer in most geographies today. And, we're very pleased with how it's performing.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Imran Khan with JPMorgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. First, active sale accounts were up 18% on a year-over-year basis. If my memory is correct, it accelerated from 17% Q3. Better understanding what's really driving the active seller counts so much for you guys? Second question, it's been reported that DVD sales are pretty weak, and I was wondering if you're seeing any weakness on the DVD sales. In fact, does changes in the [tie] rate, and are you seeing that? And any comments Blu-Ray? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, in terms of the active sellers, as we've talked about in the past, we have three customer sets. Are the consumers, sellers, and developers, and we start with those customers and each of the things that we do and work backwards. And, we focus very heavily on the seller experience over the last several years, and that's what's -- we believe, is driving the active seller account growth. In terms of categories, and it comes into categories within the breakouts that we have, like for DVD. I can't comment much, but certainly we think -- we like the -- you mentioned Blu-ray. We like the Blu-ray business, and we certainly have great selection in DVDs as well as in the original format as well as Blu-ray. And, we're certainly seeing that customers like that. But beyond that, there's not a lot I can add to it.

IMRAN KHAN: Okay. Thank you.

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Great. Thank you. Congrats. Two questions. In the current environment, how much data do you have or analysis do you actually do on your customer base to figure out spending propensities by say, geographies, zip code, vintage of when they were added, household income to better forecast the business? Are you getting to that granular level of detail to assess your trendlines of business as you look at Q1 guidance. And I guess how you look internally into budgets? And then second, does the current environment as enterprise-level spending slows down, create increased interest or open up the conversation around the web services and what you can provide for enterprises these days? Or just comment a little bit more about how those conversations are progressing?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question. We're certainly a very data-driven business, and we look at many, many different things. Primarily, though from a -- when you think about some of the data that we do look at, it's very heavily focus on the customer experience side. How do we make sure that we are priced appropriately in our products? How do we make sure we're serving our customers the way we want to in reducing all of the customer facing defects in every way that we touch the customer. Those are the areas that we focus very, very heavily on, and certainly we look at other metrics as you would expect. But, that's really where the focus is.

JEFF BEZOS: Could you repeat the web services question?

JEETIL PATEL: Yes. On web services, you lower the cost of a computing for companies that utilize the service. I'm curious as the budgets become tighter, as you look ahead, and for enterprises out there, does that open up the conversation for what you can provide larger companies on web services? Or is that still a ways to go in terms of that conversation with the larger Fortune 500 accounts in the market?

JEFF BEZOS: I think it does open up those conversations. People are, in this macro environment, looking for ways to save money and Cloud Computing does do that. So it improves utilization. It improves efficiency. There's a lot that can be done there, and so if you're looking for a silver lining in the macroenvironment. I think, that is -- what you're suggesting is correct.

JEETIL PATEL: Jeff, do you think it's still too early to see the impact of that in terms of conversations? Or are we just still too early in terms of the business cycle and the downturn?

JEFF BEZOS: No, I think on the edges you're seeing it already, and I suspect that that momentum will continue.

JEETIL PATEL: Thanks.

OPERATOR: We will go next to Jeffrey Lindsay with Sanford Bernstein.

JEFFREY LINDSAY, ANALYST, SANFORD BERNSTEIN: Thank you for taking my question. Could I ask -- could you share with us any of your thinking on your next product categories and your geographic priorities going forward international versus the US? Where you see the expansion opportunities to drive growth going forward? And then could you just mention -- could I ask Tom, do you plan to put any hedging programs in place? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the product categories, the geographies. Unfortunately, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about which categories will launch next. I apologize, I can't help on that. But again, in addition, just as a reminder, in addition to looking to new categories to add selection, we're continually adding selection within the categories that we're in. In terms of hedging, we are not doing really any hedging today using instruments. We have certainly a lot of natural hedging, and what I mean by that is, we're predominantly in those geographies that we operate in -- we're pricing in local currency, the vast majority of both the cogs as well as the operating costs are in local currency. We're certainly exposed to the income and the cash flows that we generate in those geographies, but we're not hedging those. And that's something that's been consistent for some time, and again, because we're taking a long-term view and again trying to approach it mostly from a natural perspective.

JEFFREY LINDSAY: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.

GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: Good afternoon, and congratulations on impressive results. If you could talk a little bit about the margins side of the equation. I know you had briefly touched on it, but a lot of the offline retailers had given up bottom line to get top line, and you guys got the best of both worlds. It sounds like that going forward you don't see any changes into how you think about gross margin. If the environment would get progressively more difficult, do you see yourself potentially changing some of your perspective on margins in an attempt to keep the traffic and the volume and to keep building the platform that's been successful?

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, we operate in a very competitive environment, like we talked about earlier, as well as in past calls that we've had. We're going to offer great values to customers. You can expect that to continue going forward. We certainly did see an impact, and you can see that in our gross margins during Q4. We had a larger decline certainly than we've had year-over-year than we have had if you look at the trailing twelve-month trend, and that's one of the reasons that certainly pricing is certainly a part of that. But certainly, a foundation of our model is to make sure that we offer great advice to customers, and we will continue to do so going forward.

GENE MUNSTER: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Yusef [Kwali] with Jeffreys and Company.

YUSEF KWALI, ANALYST, JEFFREYS AND COMPANY: Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on this same kind of line of questioning. As I guess with the ongoing closure of brick and mortar stores -- short-term -- not within the next two years as you were talking earlier, but short-term, within the next three to six months. What is the risk to pricing from the glut of inventory that's likely to persist from the troubled retailers through the summer? How much of that have you modeled into your numbers? And then a quick question for Tom, the mid-point of Q1 employs about 14% of revenue growth and about a 3.5% margin versus 4.8% in Q1 of last year. Where do you see the most pressure on the P&L? Is it on the gross margin side or on OpEx? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question, it's really hard to know. And so, if you look at our Q1 guidance, you can see that we've given a pretty wide range. If you look at the high-end of the range, you can see that the growth rate, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates would be 25%. That's a little bit above where we came in in Q4. If you look at the bottom line CSOI, the growth rate, excluding the impact of exchange, is approximately where we came in again in Q4. But again it's a wide range, and that wide range reflects the board of alderman both the macroenvironment and the uncertainty. And so we think it's appropriately conservative, but it reflects that uncertainty.

YUSEF KWALI: And Tom -- ?

OPERATOR: Mr. [Kwali], any further questions sure.

YUSEF KWALI: May be just a follow-up on the second question for Tom about the impacts the P&L? From the -- or what the implied guidance implies. Is there more of a pressure on gross margin or the P&L -- or I'm sorry, the OpEx?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of -- we're not giving line item detail in terms of our guidance range, but if you take a look at Q4, you can see that our operating margins were down year-over-year, and that was largely driven by gross margins being down. All that said, we still had growth in CSOI as well as free cash flow, and the revenue growth of 24%, excluding the impacts from foreign exchange rates. That's what we saw in Q4, and we'll have to get back to when we close the quarter and share with you what happened in Q1.

YUSEF KWALI: Okay. Excellent.

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.

SPENCER WANG, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Thanks, good afternoon. So, the North American direct operating expenses were up 19% year-over-year. I know that includes a lot of the allocation for the technology and content cost. But, I was wondering if you could just speak to, excluding some of the growth initiatives like Kindle, what was the underlying cost growth in North America. And then secondly, I noticed you guys bought back about $100 million of stock in the fourth quarter which I think is the first time all year you bought back stock. Can you just help us understand how you will be redeploying your free cash flow in '09? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the first question, we haven't split out the operating expenses by segment, but you can see it it in total. You can see that we did get some leverage in our total operating expense. One thing to keep in mind is when you look at our operating expense for Q4, it does not reflect just what happened in Q4. In other words, we were adding resources throughout the year in 2008. You can see from looking at the headcount that we had in -- the reporting we show in the press release that certainly our headcount growth slowed in Q4, sequentially from Q3 to Q4. So again, we're not giving line item details, but you can look at the totals between G&A, marketing, technology and content and G&A for our business. In terms of the -- from a cash standpoint, we're not -- there's not a lot I can comment on going forward. What I can tell you related to the $100 million certainly was an opportunistic buy, and we're being what we believe to be appropriately conservative with our cash.

SPENCER WANG: Great. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Sandeep Aggarwal with Collins-Stewart.

SANDEEP AGGARWAL, ANALYST, COLLINS-STEWART: Thanks for taking my question. just if you can talk about, Jeff, on the Prime members in terms of as they enter from one year to second year. Have you seen the propensity to buy changing and what about the average selling price? And will you have issued any commands in terms of the traction you're seeing with Fulfillment by Amazon.

JEFF BEZOS: Sure. One of the things that we see with Prime in terms of customer behavior is that Amazon Prime members tend to buy a wider range of categories -- of product categories, and we also see incremental lift from those customers. I think both of those things you would expect to see given that people have made a commitment by buying the $79 membership and equivalent kinds of memberships for different prices around the world. So anyway, that's a -- Amazon Prime is doing what we hoped it would do in that regard, and we're pleased with the traction. We work very hard to make sure that the customer experience for Prime members makes it worth their while to pay that $79 and to renew that membership. Fulfillment by Amazon is getting very good traction, and one of the nice closing of a feedback cycle there is that you get not only now some of the third party sales are eligible for Amazon Prime. So, to the degree that customers like Amazon Prime, and to the degree that sellers like Fulfillment by Amazon, they're closing that loop and helping each other. So, we're very pleased with both of those programs. Every time a third party seller starts using Fulfillment by Amazon, their sales go up, which the seller likes. And the customers all of a sudden get Amazon Prime membership privileges on those third party items which the consumer likes. So the two things -- it really is nice to close that loop, and we're excited about the potential of that. And, we'll keep pushing ahead on it.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Heath Terry with FBR Capital Markets.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS: Thank you. Jeff, can you look at the third party efforts in Europe? How would you compare the growth in the product offering and the composition of your partners there to where the US was at the same stage of that business? And then also, if you could give us an idea if you've seen any attrition in your third party seller base in the US or Europe that you might feel would be related to the economy, I would appreciate it?

JEFF BEZOS: Anecdotally, I don't think we have seen the kind of attrition that you're talking about. Our third party business continues to do well. As Tom said earlier, we've been working for many years on the seller experience, and we will continue to work on that. And with things like Fulfillment by Amazon, it is one of the ways that we work on improving that seller experience.

HEATH TERRY: Great, and then as far as how Europe compares to the US at this same point in your development of that offering there?

JEFF BEZOS: We don't break that out, at least not quantitatively. But, we're very happy with the way that third party sellers -- how that's performing globally.

HEATH TERRY: Great, thank you.

OPERATOR: Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.

JIM FRIEDLAND, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: The P&L from Q4, there was more leverage than usual gains on a year-over-year basis in Fulfillment, and a little bit in G&A as well. And, I was just wondering if there's anything unique going on there, or were there any one-time type items?

TOM SZKUTAK: To Fulfillment in G&A?

JIM FRIEDLAND: Yes.

TOM SZKUTAK: No, not really. I think it's -- you're seeing certainly -- we gave a wide range of guidance. We were in the upper end of the guidance range, and we got decent leverage on our operating costs as a result.

JIM FRIEDLAND: And in terms of the utilization of your Fulfillment centers, you've invested a lot lately. How much incremental investment do you need there? Is it something you need to spend less on versus previous years or more? And I'm not in (inaudible) -- .

JEFF BEZOS: Appreciate -- we did not give total year guidance, and we just gave Q1 guidance. So, in terms of moving forward there's not a lot I can talk to there. And again the reason why we didn't give guidance is because of the uncertainty in the macroenvironment. Fair enough, thanks.

OPERATOR: Our final question is from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL: Great, thank you for taking a further question from me. It relates to the accounts payable. Looks like your accounts payable days increased from 57 to 62 year-on-year. There's obviously been a lot of anecdotes about working capital tightness among suppliers. I wonder if you could talk about whether achieving the increase in accounts payable days in this environment was unusually challenging or not, given I assume you skew more toward big, well-capitalized suppliers. Thanks.

JEFF BEZOS: We work with our suppliers for our overall terms. The payment terms happen to be just one piece of that, and we continue to work and partner with those suppliers and that was really the result of a lot of work that happened throughout the year in Q4. There's not a lot more beyond that I could comment.

JAMES MITCHELL: Thank you.

OPERATOR: And that would conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the program back to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. Replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

JEFF BEZOS: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you everyone for your participation.

OPERATOR: Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com third-quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead.

ROB ELDRIDGE, VP, IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q3 '08 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO and Tom will both be available for Q&A.

   TD
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 22, 2008, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filing with the SEC including our 2007 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks Rob. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 21% to $970 million. The combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 448 million shares compared with 435 million.

Return on invested capital was 32%, down from 42%. Worldwide revenue grew 31% to $4.26 billion or 28% excluding the $80 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. In Q3 2007 worldwide revenue benefited by approximately 290 basis points of year-over-year growth from Harry Potter 7 sales plus attachments. Excluding Harry Potter 7 plus attachments and changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue growth was 31%.

Media revenue increased $2.49 billion, up 19% or 17% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $1.64 billion, up 52% or 49% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 38% of worldwide sales, up from 33%.

Worldwide unit growth was 30% or 32% excluding Harry Potter 7 plus attachments. Prime membership increased more than 70% from the prior year and Amazon Premium, the French version of Amazon Prime, launched on October 1. We expect more customers to save time and money by using Amazon Prime to ship their gifts to friends and family this holiday season.

Active customer accounts exceeded $84 million, up 17%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $1.4 million, up 17%. Seller units were 31% of total units unchanged from the prior year.

Worldwide gross profit was $999 million, up 31%. We recently lowered the free shipping threshold from 15 pounds to 5 pounds in the UK. Super Saver Shipping is an important component of our overall value we provide and customers have saved more than $700 million with our free shipping offers over the past 12 months.

Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing and technology and content and G&A combined was $768 million or 18% of sales, up 8 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $378 million or 8.9% of revenue compared with 8.7%.

We opened new fulfillment centers in Arizona, Indiana and Pennsylvania to support continued expansion of selection and customer demand. Technology and content was $226 million or 5.3% of revenue compared with 5.6%.

Now I will talk about our segment results and, consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock based compensation or other operating expense.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 29% to $2.3 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $1.25 billion. Kindle's selection continues to grow. Since inception, we have more than doubled the number of books, magazines, newspapers and blogs available to be delivered wirelessly in less than one minute.

Kindle titles already account for more than 10% of unit sales for books that are available in both digital and print formats. We have ramped up manufacturing capacity over the past 10 months and Kindles are in stock and available for immediate shipment.

Kindle sales since launch have significantly exceeded our expectations. We will not introduce the new version of the Kindle until next year at the earliest.

EGM revenue grew 51% to $950 million representing 41% of North America revenues, up from 35%. North America gross profit grew 28% to $586 million and gross margin decreased 24 basis points to 25.5% driven by lower prices for our customers including free shipping offers in Amazon Prime and changes in product mix partially offset by higher other revenue. North America segment operating income increased 12% to $88 million, a 3.8% operating margin.

In the international segment revenue grew 33% to $1.96 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusting for the $80 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 24% to $1.25 billion or 18% excluding FX and EGM grew 54% to $690 million or 48% excluding FX. EGM now represents 35% of international revenues, up from 30%.

International gross profit grew 37% to $413 million or grew 32% excluding FX. Our gross margin increased 53 basis points to 21.1% driven by increases in 3P product sales and improvements in vendor pricing partially offset by lower prices to our customers and changes in product mix.

International segment operating income increased 46% to $143 million, a 7.3% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from FX, international segment operating income increased 39%.

CSOI grew 31% to $231 million or 5.4% of revenue, unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the $5 million favorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 28%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 26% to $154 million or 3.6% of net sales.

Our income tax expense was $59 million in Q3 or a 33% rate for the quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 28% and net cash tax paid will be less than $75 million.

However, there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and business acquisitions or investments. We're endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. GAAP net income was $118 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with $80 million and $0.19 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $416 million to $2.32 billion year-over-year. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government agency securities, AAA-rated money market funds and other investment-grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value.

Inventory increased 36% to $1.32 billion and inventory turns were 12.4, unchanged from the prior year even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 34% to $2.24 billion and accounts payable days increased to 63 from 62 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $240 million from a year ago to $731 million. Our Q3 2008 capital expenditures were $102 million.

During the quarter approximately $132 million in principal amount of our 4.75 convertible subordinated notes converted into 1.7 million shares of common stock and we redeemed for cash the remaining total of $266 million in principal amount of the notes.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. We experienced slower rates of growth towards the end of the third quarter coinciding with disruptions in the global financial markets.

While guidance takes into account these growth rates, our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our euro denominated debt to market quarterly, intercompany balances in foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock based compensation estimates and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently.

For Q4, we expect net sales of between $6 billion and $7 billion, a growth of between 6 and 23%. This guidance anticipates greater than 500 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange.

GAAP operating income to be between $145 million and $305 million or between 46% decline and 13% growth; this includes approximately $85 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense to be between $230 million and $390 million or between 30% decline and 19% growth.

For the calendar year 2008, we expect net sales of between $18.46 billion and $19.46 billion, a growth of between 24 and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.

GAAP operating income to be between $716 million and $876 million or between 9% growth and 34% growth. These amounts include the impact of the $53 million non-cash gain recognized in the second quarter of 2008 on the sale of the Company's European DVD rental assets.

This includes approximately $300 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $964 million and $1.124 billion or between 13% growth and 32% growth. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation.

We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Great, thanks Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: It looked like your third-quarter margin was better than your guidance despite the new fulfillment centers, whereas for the fourth quarter you're guiding for margins to be flat to down year on year. Is that a delta gain for fourth quarter primarily because you anticipate cutting prices to sustain sales growth or is there anything else that is going into the margin evolution?

TOM SZKUTAK: Well it's -- the guidance that we've given, we gave a relatively wide range of guidance that we believe to be appropriately conservative and prudent certainly in this environment. And so it depends on really where you look at the range. You see also a fairly sizable range on the operating margins while on the bottom. But it reflects again both the wide range and also the fact that our -- implicit in the assumptions that we gave for Q4 certainly, a sizable change from currency as well which is impacting both the top and the bottom.

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, Barclays Capital.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Can you tell us what you're seeing in terms of early discounting from your competitors as we go toward the holidays? And what level of discounting does the midpoint of your CSOI guidance imply relative to last holiday season? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: You know, we operate in a very competitive environment. That's not something that is new. We have competitors offline. As you go to your home or office, you drive by or walk by those everyday. We have certainly a number of online competitors as well.

We have -- we're very used to operating in a very competitive environment and we have been very successful at making sure that we have great prices for customers in this environment. And that is not something that's new, that's something that we have been dealing with for many years.

And so it's certainly hard to predict what will happen over the course of any given quarter. But what we think will happen is reflected in the guidance that we've given today.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Stifel Nicolaus.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Two questions, if I could. First in terms of the gross and operating margin by region, the domestic margin continues to go down and international go up and your third-party units have been sustained at about 31% of total.

So I'm just wondering if the margin impact is driven by the mix shift where the US business first party is growing faster than third and the third party faster than first international. And then secondly, could you give either a number or the impact that you had implied in fourth quarter guidance for currency when you gave guidance on the third-quarter call for the implied fourth quarter guidance?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, your questions on margins to start with, those were operating margins or --?

SCOTT DEVITT: Well both but I guess maybe just looking at gross margin because there is (multiple speakers)

TOM SZKUTAK: You were cutting out (inaudible)

SCOTT DEVITT: It would be gross margin.

TOM SZKUTAK: Certainly you are seeing -- just think about from an opportunity standpoint, we have more room to certainly -- or more opportunity certainly in our international segment as you look at our gross margins. That's something that we've been talking about for quite some time. There's a number of factors there.

Certainly we had a lot more newer categories over the past few years then in North America, although we are adding categories in both segments and selection dramatically in both segments. But you have a number of factors but certainly we're earlier in third-party and international as well as the category mix in terms of where we are from a geography standpoint, our ability to get better prices with suppliers has improved. Those are factors that are certainly impacting our international segment.

In terms of the exchange guidance, we obviously did not give (inaudible) implied, we didn't give guidance for Q4. Last time we gave guidance for Q3 and the total year. But I think this will be helpful.

Basically if you take the top end of the range, the $20.1 billion that we gave last time for revenue, right now we're talking either just under 19.5, 19.463. So that's a little over $600 million. We said that last time that the total year would be more than 400 basis points of favorable impact from exchange. Now we're saying approximately 100 basis points.

In dollar terms that's approximately $500 million and so -- and the bulk of that, more than $400 million is in Q4 from a change from last time, if that's helpful (multiple speakers). The remainder is in Q3. If you remember we said approximately 450 basis points for Q3 for exchange, came in approximately 240 roughly. So that is the delta, if that helps.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citi.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Great, a couple of quick questions. That was a very significant increase in headcount this quarter, more than we have seen in the past. Was there something new about where those people are being deployed?

Secondly, you made a comment about seeing some disruptions at the end of the third quarter from some of the economic dislocations. Did you see that continue into the December quarter? And then the final question has to do -- at the very high end of your range, your guidance range in Q4m if you adjust for FX implies very little deceleration on a much tougher organic revenue comp.

So I guess the question is, are you seeing something that -- what would allow you to actually do something like 28% organic revenue growth? Are there new categories, new international launches that could allow you to get to the high end of their range in a really troubling market with a tough comp? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm sorry, could you just repeat the first part of the question (multiple speakers)

TOM SZKUTAK: A lot of new employees, 2100 new employees added in the quarter. That's a lot more than we have seen in the past. Any new place for the deployment of those employees?

TOM SZKUTAK: The vast majority of those employees, a very high percentage of those are in operations and customer service as we get ready for Q4. In some of my opening remarks you also heard me talk about we opened three new fulfillment centers and certainly that is part of that increase. So again, a very high percentage of that is again office and CS related.

In terms of the guidance, you mentioned the upper end, we gave a pretty wide range of guidance. We think that that is prudent during this -- the environment's uncertain and it's -- we have limited visibility as all companies have in this environment. So we think that that is appropriate. But again certainly the upper end of guidance.

If you look at our Q3, we saw very solid growth, 31% on a dollar basis, 28% excluding exchange. Keep in mind that we are overlapping Harry Potter 7 from last year. The impact that we mentioned last year was approximately 290 basis points. So if you back that out, it rounds to 31% growth excluding Harry Potter and foreign exchange rates.

And we think we are relatively well positioned. We have been working very hard for years on making sure that we have a great experience with customers. We are trying to make Q4 even better than last year. We think we're well-positioned to do that.

We have added a lot of selection and we have worked very hard at pricing. We have not only our free shipping offers around the world but certainly Prime has grown a lot since last Q4. So we're very optimistic from a customer experience standpoint and we will have to see where that ends up from a revenue perspective and that's why we're giving the wide range that we've given today.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: In September can you talk about the fundamentals? You did see some softness. Was it customers, units? I imagine also ASP's on the currency but any detail on that? And then secondly, some nice metrics on the Kindle. As books go more digital and you hopefully can capitalize it on the Kindle, does that help Amazon's long-term profitability or hurt it? How do you look at that over a long-term basis?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of what we have seen, I talked about currency. Currency moved a lot as part of the disruption in financial markets towards the end of the quarter -- through the quarter and towards the end of the quarter and obviously much more recently as well.

And in terms of -- we certainly saw some slowness of growth and in areas as you would expect with the disruptions in financial markets. One data point, certainly we saw a deceleration of growth in purchase items over $1000 and so that's certainly one item that we saw.

But again what we have seen is factored into the guidance that we have given. And as I mentioned, because of our model and because we have worked very hard at not only having low prices and affording low prices but knowing where we are relative to others, we think that that positions us very well in this environment.

It positions us well in up environments. Customers want great values, good environments, but they want especially good prices in this environment, the macroenvironment that we're in today. So again hard to tell, which is why the range we have given for guidance, where we will end up but we think we're positioned very well.

JUSTIN POST: And then on the Kindle, how do you see that affecting your long-term profitability in the book segment?

JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT, CEO, CHAIRMAN, AMAZON.COM, INC.: One thing that I think you could imagine happening over the long-term there is that the prices of books will be cheaper. So most of the books that we are offering on Kindle today are $9.99 even if they are $20 or $25 in print form. And so you can see that -- I think probably the best way to answer your question is we would hope to sell many more units and make less money per unit but all in have a very strong business.

JUSTIN POST: Thanks, Jeff.

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: A couple questions. First of all, Jeff, maybe can you characterize how -- what you're seeing of this downturn or kind of issues in the marketplace or spending habits compares to what you saw maybe Q3 early Q4 back in 2000 when the bubble burst just as a basis of comparison how we should characterize it?

Second, your operating margins -- consolidated segment operating margins are down sequentially in Q4 when typically you get the FX or economies of scale advantage on your side. I guess I'm just trying to figure out -- understandable that your FX is going -- the FX is going against you, but it seems like you should be seeing your costs come down a bit at least from an international standpoint.

I guess is there something else going on in the number? Your plan to kind of keep spending up as it relates to marketing or is overhead and fulfillment that's going to be the kind of drain from a margin standpoint as you look at Q4 relative to Q3? Thanks.

JEFF BEZOS: On the first part of your question relative to 2001, it's a very difficult question to answer in large part because Amazon has changed so much in that intervening time period. We have so many more product categories now than we did then. The scale of the business is very different. The operating efficiency of the business is very different.

We've spent a lot of time and hard work reducing defects at the root so that we can have lower operating costs and pass on lower prices to customers. We're -- I love our position today in the marketplace because we have been spending so much time making sure we are the low-cost provider and that is something that is likely to be appealing to people this kind of economy. So it's not only low-cost but also -- low-cost on (inaudible) prices but matching that with free shipping.

So difficult to make that comparison. If you go back in time, we were able to find back then certain segments of our business which were impacted, but they were very technology related like computer books and investing in business books and so on. Our business is now so much more diversified across product categories. Although as Tom mentioned, we have seen deceleration in items for example of above $1000. So I guess I would leave it at that. Very difficult to make crisp comparisons relative to that time period.

JEETIL PATEL: What about customer behaviorwise?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of your operating margin question in terms of looking at it sequentially, as you see from the guidance, the implied operating margins would have at the higher end being sequentially up and on the lower end down. And certainly when you plan for the seasonal quarter, you plan for peak. We're getting ready certainly for what we hope to be a strong quarter. We think we're well-positioned for that and you know in having facilities and associated structure to support that.

So that's what we're trying to do, trying to make sure that we support it. So if we are at the lower end of guidance, we will have certainly some of the costs but not the revenue to support that. But again, we think we're well-positioned for Q4.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Banc of America Securities.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: We have seen third-party data suggesting that your share increase in the large TV market has continued to do very well. We're wondering if you expect the move to digital broadcasting by February to accelerate TV and related sales in Q4 and Q1. And then separately, would you provide any additional color on the growth in advertising related revenue to your business? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: It's really hard to say on the TV side. What I would say though is like the comment we made on -- across the business we're going to make sure we have great prices and that's something that we have been doing and we do have great selection in that area that you're referring to in terms of the large TV. So we're certainly a -- we should be in the customers consideration set given the service that we provide and the selection and the prices. So I think that's -- in terms of what will happen related to next year is difficult to say.

BRIAN PITZ: Just on advertising, any comments?

TOM SZKUTAK: Historically our primary means of driving demand has been to focus on what we consider to be the primary customer experience drivers -- low prices, free shipping, selection, speedy delivery. And we're going to continue -- we think that's likely to continue to be the best way to drive demand in our business.

OPERATOR: Jeffrey Lindsay, Sanford Bernstein.

JEFFREY LINDSAY, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: Would you be able to give us some insights as to your plans for the payments business and how fast do you see that moving ahead? And do you think it's going to be meaningful contributor to growth or margins going forward? If so, what timescale? And then also, could you just give us an indication when you make electronic sales of media, are they completely cannibalistic to your traditional media sales? Or are they additive? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: So far what we have seen with the Kindle book units is that they are additive to physical book units. So when somebody buys a Kindle, in the period after -- sort of the post-purchase period post buying a Kindle, they buy 1.6 times as many Kindle books as they bought physical books prior to buying a Kindle and they continue to buy the same number of physical books. So that is what we've seen so far and it's a very -- obviously a very positive outcome. We hope that continues.

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JPMorgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: One key question is if this recession lasts longer than many of us would like it to, a lot of companies are talking about cost containment. As you look out over the next 18 to 24 months, how are you thinking about managing your cost over the next 18 to 24 months? Do you think you continue to invest in the business or you think if there is a recession you will contain some costs?

JEFF BEZOS: Our thinking is that we are going to continue to invest in the business but we're going to be especially prudent in how we make those investments. We just think that is sensible in the context of this macroenvironment. And let me answer the payments question from the prior caller who I forgot to answer.

Basically we have a couple of services today, external payment services, one called the Flexible Payments Service, Checkout by Amazon, Simple Pay. Those are the three primary ones. And these things are new offerings.

The Flexible Payments Service is designed for software developers to be able to design and build their own payment services or to deeply integrate payments into whatever application they happen to be building and it has a sophisticated and very well thought through set of APIs that enable great flexibility. Checkout by Amazon and Simple Pay are for merchants on third-party Web sites to be able to incorporate Amazon payments into their Web sites so that their customers can use their Amazon credentials when checking out.

These are new seeds that we've planted and the question was what kind of timeline might those businesses become meaningful and that's very difficult to say. We would keep working at those businesses and hope that over time they would become meaningful.

TOM SZKUTAK: And just to add on to Jeff's previous answer related to the next 18 to 24 months, and he was speaking from a program perspective, keep in mind that we have been operating in an environment of challenging prices, very competitive environment for some time. We've also been operating in an environment where we've been offering free shipping for example while fuel prices have been going up dramatically.

These are things that are not new to us. And so in addition to the programs and being prudent, we're going to continue to work on defect reduction which will help us from a cost structure standpoint, continue to work on other things that make our overall cost structure improved over time.

IMRAN KHAN: Can I ask one more question? So I was going to ask -- you talked about the weakness in the overall business. Could you give us maybe more color into what kind of trends you're seeing in the UK market?

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, I don't have a lot to add to the UK but again on the total business, we're actually very pleased with what we saw in Q3. You know if you -- we think in a relatively challenging environment, we think 31% growth on a dollar basis, 28% excluding exchange and 31% excluding exchange and Harry Potter is relatively strong, and we think that we're well-positioned for customers and the environment that we're in during Q4 and we are getting ready right now for that seasonal time.

OPERATOR: James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL: I apologize for taking two questions but I guess my question was just once again, you have dramatically broadened the revenue range you're guiding to for the fourth quarter this year versus a much narrower range for example in the fourth quarter last year and I fully understand that the world is a different place today unfortunately from what it was then. But does the broader revenue range purely reflect greater uncertainty about constant currency spending by consumers or are you effectively building in some headwind or tail room for further FX moves given how volatile the currencies have been the last few weeks?

TOM SZKUTAK: It reflects a broad range of items and, as I mentioned earlier, all companies have limited visibility we think right now and we are no different. And so we are putting together what we believe to be appropriately conservative guidance.

It is wider range than we have given before both in dollar terms and percentage terms. We think that is prudent in this environment. Again, we're going to focus on what we do best which is satisfying customers and we think we are well-positioned to do that. And so that's what we plan on doing.

JAMES MITCHELL: Can I ask a super quick follow-on question? It looks like you have cut the Super Saver delivery charge in the UK from 15 pounds to five pounds. Do you see yourself stimulating growth globally through lower shipping costs this Christmas and is that part of what is going into your margin consideration?

TOM SZKUTAK: We reduced the Super Saver delivery threshold from 15 pounds to five pounds so you now in the UK only have to order five pounds or more of items to get the Super Saver delivery. And basically we did that because from a cost structure point of view, we were in a position to do it. So you should think of that as an example of us doing the kinds of things you have seen us do over the last 10 years which is trying to figure out how to lower prices and then to lower prices.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations Web site at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com second quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.

For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead.

   TD
ROB ELDRIDGE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2008 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2008 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2007 annual report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC -- each of which is posted on our Investor Relations website -- you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007.

Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 16% to $816 million. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 446 million shares compared with 435 million.

Return on invested capital was 29%, down from 39%. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $4.06 billion or 35%, excluding the $182 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in FX. Media revenue increased to $2.41 billion, up 31% or 25%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $1.53 billion, up 58% or 52%, excluding foreign exchange rates.

Worldwide EGM increased to 38% of worldwide sales, up from 34%. Worldwide unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded 81 million, up 18%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.4 million, up 18%. Seller units were 29% of total units, unchanged from the prior year. Worldwide gross profit was $967 million, up 38%.

Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation.

Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content, and G&A combined was $722 million or 17.8% of sales, an improvement of 83 basis points year-over-year. Tech and content was $218 million or 5.4% of revenue compared with 6.1%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation, or other operating expense line item.

In the North America segment, revenue grew 35% to $2.17 billion. Media revenue grew 25% to $1.15 billion. EGM revenue grew 52% to $920 million, representing 42% of North America revenues, up from 38%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, consumables, and soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes and sporting goods. North America gross profit grew 29% to $559 million, and gross margin decreased 129 basis points to 25.8%, driven by changes in product mix and lower prices for our customers, including free shipping offers at Amazon Prime. North America segment operating income increased 17% to $96 million, a 4.4% operating margin.

In the international segment, revenue grew 47% to $1.89 billion. Revenue growth was 34%, adjusted for the $179 million year-over-year favorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter.

Media revenue grew 38% to $1.26 billion or 25%, excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $611 million or 52%, excluding FX. EGM now represent 32% of international revenues, up from 28%. International gross profit grew 52% to $408 million, or grew 38%, excluding foreign exchange rates, while gross margin increased 66 basis points to 21.5%, driven by increases in 3P product sales, improvements in vendor pricing, and higher Other Revenue, partially offset by lower prices to our customers and changes in product mix.

International segment operating income increased 80% to $149 million, a 7.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 56%.

Consolidated segment operating income grew 49% to $245 million or 6% of revenue, up 31 basis points. Excluding the $17 million favorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 38%.

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 86% to $217 million or 5.3% of net sales. Included in the second quarter of 2008 GAAP operating income is a $53 million non-cash gain recognized on the sale of our European DVD rental assets.

Our income tax expense was $46 million in Q2 or a 22% rate for the quarter. We estimate that our effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 28%, and that cash taxes paid will be less than $75 million. However, there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction, and the business acquisitions or investments. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash-pay basis, not for tax expense on a financial reported basis.

GAAP net income was $158 million or $0.37 per diluted share compared with $78 million and $0.19 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $789 million to $2.63 billion year-over-year. Inventory increased 51% to $1.11 billion and inventory turns improved to 13, up from 12.9 in the prior year, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies, and introduced new product categories.

Accounts Payable increased 52% to $1.96 billion, and Accounts Payable days increased to 58 from 54 in the prior year. Our investment in net success has increased $208 million from one year ago to $651 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, capital expenditures increased $78 million, up 40% year-over-year. Our Q2 2008 capital expenditures were $69 million.

During the quarter, approximately $473 million in principal amount of our four and three-quarter convertible subordinated notes converted into 6.1 million shares of common stock, and we regained $27 million in principal amount of the notes.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there's a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intracompany balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.

Our guidance assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.

For Q3, we expect net sales of between $4.2 billion and $4.425 billion, our growth of between 29% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 450 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.

GAAP operating income to be between $115 million and $160 million or between 6% decline and 31% growth. This includes approximately $80 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $195 million and $240 million or between 10% growth and 36% growth.

For calendar year 2008, we expect net sales of between $19.35 billion and $20.1 billion, our growth of between 30% to 35%. This guidance anticipates greater than 400 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.

GAAP operating income to be between $745 million and $920 million or between 14% growth and 40% growth. This includes approximately $295 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $1.040 billion and $1.215 billion or between 22% growth and 43% growth.

Our goal continues to be operating leverage in 2008, with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability, including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $325 million.

We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share, while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand.

Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom.

Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

OPERATOR: Yes, thank you. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Mark Mahaney, Citigroup.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: I wanted to ask about some of the digital media offerings. Are there any data points? It's a highly competitive space -- music, video, and now eReaders online, particularly the first two. What are the data points that you look at to judge how well you're doing in that segment? Anything you can share with us? And then any comment at all on the Kindle and what kind of -- how many units you've sold or any kind of demand metrics there? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: We don't really break out those digital figures. What I can tell you on Kindle is that we're not releasing the number of units of Kindle that we've sold, the number of devices. What we have said is that we are -- if you look at the universe of titles where we sell the Kindle version -- so those 140,000 different titles -- the percentage of all-in units, they're in Kindle unit form versus their physical book equivalents for that same universe, is low double digits at this point, which we're very excited about.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: Yes, it's two-part on one topic question. It looks like for several quarters now third party units were growing faster than your own units. It looks like it was kind of flat this quarter. Are there any changes there?

And as you look forward, it looks like margins might be slightly lower, operating income margins going forward. Is that trajectory affecting your margin outlook as you look out to the back half? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: To answer your first question, third party units as a percentage of total units was 29%, which is flat with last year. Keep in mind that our unit growth did accelerate in total. So, our unit growth was 32%. Also keep in mind -- or another data point is, our third party units did grow faster than our retail units this quarter. So again, we're still seeing very, very good growth there.

A couple other things to think about. The active seller accounts, if you will, are up 18% year-over-year. That compares to a year ago, where they were up 11%. We've had several quarters where we've seen accelerated growth of active seller accounts.

So again, we think that the business looks good. It's really not impacting the guidance as we think about it. We're very positive about both our retail business and our third party business. Ultimately, the customer will decide what units they buy, and we're trying to make the experience better for customers and for sellers.

OPERATOR: David Joseph, Morgan Stanley.

DAVID JOSEPH, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Tom, on that point of unit growth, so it seemed like it accelerated while gross margin actually declined year-over-year. So it seems that you might -- that Amazon might be getting a little bit aggressive on pricing. We're wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more color on that?

And then just really a math question -- excluding the sale of an asset in Europe for $45 million, operating margin ex-dot-com, according to our math, would have come in line with our estimate of about 6.0%. Is that correct?

TOM SZKUTAK: The first part of your question -- can you repeat the first part? I'm sorry, just -- you were cutting out a little bit.

DAVID JOSEPH: Yes, I'm sorry. With your unit growth accelerating year-over-year while your gross margin is declining, it makes us think that you're maybe getting aggressive on pricing. Wondering if you might be able to confirm that for us.

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. In terms of pricing, we've been pretty consistent. We're trying to make sure we have very competitive pricing across many different categories and many different geographies. And so we've spent a lot of time trying to make sure that that is the case. And we're always looking for ways to improve that to make sure we have the most -- the best information as we do that.

So that, in terms of a process standpoint, nothing has really changed there. In terms of your question on the gain, the gain was -- the $53 million gain was not included in our guidance. It's included in our GAAP operating income; it's not included in our CSOI. So, if you look at our CSOI of 245, it's not included in that number. I don't know if that's helpful or not.

So the $245 million, again, the range we gave for CSOI for Q2 was $200 million to $240 million. We came in at $245 million. The $245 million does not include the gain.

DAVID JOSEPH: Okay, great. Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure.

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: A couple of questions. It seems like the flywheels working internationally, if you look at third party and prime, it looks like you're kind of getting the similar lift that you got in the US, as you kind of had the prime service ramp up. I guess if you could frame for us where international stands in terms of the ramp phase, relative to going back in the North American market, where timeframe revolution, where international looks today with third party and Prime versus domestically?

And then, second, I guess is there ways for you to leverage your customer buying relationships with consumers and your technology platform to basically go after other retailing opportunities? I guess I'm trying to allude to a universal wish list and how that fits in, and maybe even a universal payment service from an affiliate standpoint, how that fits into the grand scheme of things?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of the question regarding third party and Prime, it's difficult to give a timeframe, but I would say on both, it's certainly earlier for both, So, both in terms of third party as well as Prime in terms of penetration. And so -- and that's really because we've been at it longer in North America. So we like the progress that we're making on both accounts in North America and international. But it's earlier, as you would expect.

And the second part of the question, maybe you could just repeat that?

JEETIL PATEL: Yes, I'm just trying to understand how your customer buying relationships with over 80 million customers and your technology that you've been building out for years now -- just how does an idea like universal wish list, which is, I think, available on the site or payments -- fit into that? How do you take your existing assets and how do those fit into that?

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, in the case of universal wish list, we have a very large number of folks using the Amazon wish list and we have for a number of years. And so that's a very -- it's basically a thriving feature. And the idea behind universal wish list is that it's really just a customer service, that as people go about their business on the Web, if they would like to add something to their wish list from another vendor, another website, we make it very easy for them to do that. So then they have still one place to point their friends and relatives to, to see their universal wish list.

OPERATOR: James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Could you talk a little bit about your third quarter operating income guidance? I think in 2007, your operating income ticked up a little quarter-on-quarter from Q2 to Q3. And for this year, you're guiding for it to tick down a little. I wondered if that was due to just general corporate conservativism or whether there was any specific driver?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. The only thing I'd call out is -- and we have announced a number of capacity increases in Fulfillment -- and certainly with the large growth that we've seen, you're seeing -- you saw leverage in Q1 and Q2 on our Fulfillment expense as a percentage of revenue. With the added capacity, it's a little bit lumpy in Q3, but we're adding additional capacity to serve Q4. It is typical that we do it in Q3. We also do it in other quarters, but it's just a little bit lumpy in Q3, and that's certainly reflected in the guidance that we've given for Q3.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Banc of America Securities.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: First a question on taxes. Would you comment on any changes in demand from New York state customers, given the recent collection of sales taxes there?

And then a separate question on gross margins. A gap remains between North America and international gross margins. Can you talk about the key leverage points that will help to close the gap there? Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of New York, it's really too early to comment there. But I just want to remind everyone that we really collect either sales tax or value-added tax on approximately 50% of our business today. And we collect in a number of states in the US. We collect in a number of the geographies outside of the US. And so, we have very good businesses in those geographies.

In terms of your gross margin question, you're absolutely right. We do have a delta between our North America and international business. A couple of the dynamics there, one of them which we talked about a little bit earlier -- certainly our third party penetration is higher in North America than it is in international. And so, that's an opportunity for us.

Certainly as we get to scale, we've launched many, many new categories in international over the past 18 months. And as those categories get more and more to scale, there's opportunities on the margin side there. And so those are certainly the key ones in terms of differences.

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Jeffrey Lindsay, Sanford Bernstein.

JEFFREY LINDSAY, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & COMPANY, INC.: Could I ask two questions? First, what is the likely impact on your delivery and fulfillment charges, particularly with regard to Prime, of increased transportation costs? Is this really a 2009 phenomenon for you or is there a possible increase in delivery costs coming through the pipeline?

And then second, could you just give us a comment on how you're seeing any impact from consumer confidence on sales? Product mix, sales frequency, small ticket items, just -- are you seeing any difference now that consumer confidence is significantly lower? Thank you.

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: On the fuel prices, we suspect that higher fuel prices may be a relative advantage for us, both in terms of relative to physical world stores because of the expense of driving to a store; even just driving 10 miles these days is a few dollars worth of gasoline. And consumers, we suspect, are beginning to take that into account and think about that, and try to do trip consolidation. And so certainly our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime become very high -- are clearly of even more value to customers under that set of circumstances.

And then relative to other online retailers, because of our scale, we have a distributed Fulfillment Center Network that places products closer to customers, that allows us to do fast transportation to customers, fast deliveries to customers, but usually using ground transportation instead of air transportation. And ground transportation is much more fuel-efficient than air transportation.

So the -- probably this is a relative advantage for Amazon. And it's our job to insulate customers. Since we offer free shipping and Amazon Prime offers fast free shipping, the burden is upon us to make sure that we can do that in a way that is economical for us, so that customers can continue to enjoy those free shipping offers. And we have clearly no intention of changing those. We'll keep them in place.

JEFFREY LINDSAY: But do you think it will impact your margins negatively going forward?

JEFF BEZOS: This is something that we've been dealing with for quite some time. It's part of our overall cost structure. We started in the US, some of the free shipping offers back in 2002, I believe. Oil prices were around $22 a barrel back in 2002. They've continued to grow. And certainly, it is more costly, but it's not something that's really new to us. It's part of our overall thinking as we look at our costs.

JEFFREY LINDSAY: And are you seeing any change in consumer buying habits because of the lower consumer confidence?

JEFF BEZOS: Well, we're probably not the best bellwether for the economy. And certainly one indication of that is just looking at our overall -- the overall growth rates that you see for Q2. We had growth rates of 35%, excluding the impact of exchange. That accelerated from last year, where we saw a little bit under 33%, excluding exchange, and also an acceleration from Q1. So, I don't think it can really help.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Stifel Nicolaus.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Thanks for taking my question. It relates to the guidance and the change to the guidance. Last quarter, you gave full year GAAP [op'ing] guidance [740] to [940]. And the GAAP operating income this quarter was, I believe, [$57 million] above expectations, including the $53 million gain. So I'm trying to get my hands around the updated guidance, which is mostly unchanged from the prior GAAP operating income guidance, and whether this new guidance includes or excludes the $53 million gain. Thanks.

TOM SZKUTAK: It's a great question. Yes, the GAAP -- the guidance excludes the $53 million gain.

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth, Lehman Brothers.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions. First on CapEx. It looks like you raised your outlook by about $25 million, so CapEx is now expected to be up about 46% year-over-year. Can you talk about why the increase there?

And then secondly, can you detail the contribution from the audible during the quarter? Thank you.

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the CapEx, the increase -- we spend CapEx in a number of different areas. Certainly a big portion of it is fulfillment-related; also infrastructure-related, and then a few other smaller areas. And so, those are really the drivers for the CapEx growth -- not only the increase from 300 to 325, but also the increase year-over-year. So, really, it relates back to growth of the business, which is causing that increase.

DOUG ANMUTH: And the audible contribution?

TOM SZKUTAK: We're not breaking out the audible piece in our results for Q2.

OPERATOR: Steve Weinstein, Pacific Crest.

STEVE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES: Great. Thanks. I just have an accounting question. If we want to back out the $53 million gain for the sale of the DVD business, what would the offsetting tax impact be for that?

TOM SZKUTAK: I can't talk to the tax piece. I guess the best way to say it is the estimate for the year is 28%. And you see a first-half effective tax rate of 26%, and that gain is reflected in the first-half results and the 26% effective tax rate. So, again, our estimate for the year is 28%.

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JPMorgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thank for taking my questions. Two questions. Jeff, one of the biggest value propositions for your biggest consumer business is the price discount and free shipping and things like that. As 30% of your business is now coming from the sellers business, how do you ensure the quality that are the security and the safety that the consumer gets from your main business? So that's question number one.

The second question is for Tom. The free cash flow growth rate was 16% versus 51%. And I can understand it can fluctuate quarter-over-quarter, but how should we think about the full year free cash flow growth rate? Thank you.

JEFF BEZOS: Well, for your first question, the first way we do that is because we have an astonishingly good group of sellers who take their -- the customer experience and the customer service that they provide on Amazon very, very seriously. And we give them lots of metrics and tools to help them manage that experience. So, that's sort of the first answer to your question, is the sellers do a very good job; some better than others. And we try to make it very clear, both to the sellers and to the consumers, the quality of that particular seller.

The second thing is that we are more and more having sellers take advantage of Fulfillment by Amazon, which is a program that lets sellers put their inventory in our fulfillment centers. This is a very big advantage for sellers because it increases their sales. When sellers move into Fulfillment by Amazon, they end up selling more.

The second reason it's a big advantage, it's a big advantage for the consumer because now those third party items are eligible for Super Saver Shipping. They're eligible for Amazon Prime. They can be -- a third party item can be married together and put in a box with an Amazon retail item, so that the outbound transportation is more efficient.

So there are a lot of advantages to Fulfillment by Amazon. And that's another kind of second part to the answer for how that third party business can have a very high level of customer experience for our consumers. Your question is a very good one. It's one we think about a lot and we take very seriously.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the second part of your question, we're not giving guidance on and/or free cash flow, but just one comment for a second on the Q2 growth. Q2 of last year, if you go back to actually the Q1 of last year, we had free cash flow growth of 4%. Q2 on a trailing 12 months last year was a growth of 87% and the sequential growth was 34%. That was a difficult compare and a little bit of an anomaly compared to the last several years.

If you look back over the last several year period, you'll see that our sequential growth that we had this quarter from Q1 to Q2 was very consistent with what we've seen other than that. And if you look at the underlying pieces and metrics that support free cash flow, you'll see that our consolidated segment operating income over the past 12 months was up 56%. Our AP days were up four days. Our inventories [or] essentially turns were essentially flat -- 13 versus 12.9. And our CapEx was up 40%, which was just slightly under our trailing 12-month revenue growth.

So those are the underlying pieces that I think are most significant.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

JEFF BEZOS: Thank you, everybody.

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com first quarter 2008 financial results teleconference. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.

ROB ELDRIDGE, VP IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2008 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.

   TD
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflects management's views as of today, April 23, 2008 only. It will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2007 annual report on Form 10-K.

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconsiderations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing twelve-month free cash flow increased 51% to $788 million. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 435 million shares compared with 430 million.

Return on invested capital was 32%, up from 30%. Worldwide revenue grew 37% to $4.13 billion, or 31% excluding the $185 million of favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.

Media revenue increased to $2.54 billion, up 28%, or 21% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $1.48 billion, up 56%, or 50% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 36% of worldwide sales up from 31%.

Worldwide unit growth was 31%. Active customer accounts exceeded 79 million, up 19%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.3 million, up 17%. Seller units were 30% of total units versus 29%. Worldwide gross profit was $956 million, up 33%.

Now we will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $698 million, or 16.9% of sales, an improvement of 103 basis points year-over-year. Tech and content was $203 million or 4.9% of revenue compared with 5.5%.

Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items.

In the North America segment revenue grew 31% to $2.13 billion. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 46% to $826 million, representing 39% of North America revenues, up from 35%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and babies, consumables and soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes and sporting goods.

North American gross profit grew 29% to $569 million, and gross margin decreased 33 basis points to 26.7%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.

North America segment operating income increased 52% to $130 million, a 6.1% operating margin. In the international segment revenue grew 44% to $2.01 billion. Revenue growth was 31% adjusting for the $179 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 34% to $1.34 billion, or 22% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 71% to $655 million, or 56% excluding FX. EGM now represents 33% of international revenues, up from 27%.

International gross profit grew 38% to $387 million, or grew 26% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 81 basis points to 19.3%, driven by lower prices to our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by increases in product sales by our sellers.

International segment operating income increased 36% to $128 million, a 6.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from FX, international segment operating income increased 19%.

CSOI grew 44% to $258 million, or 6.2% of revenue, up 29 basis points. Excluding the $14 million favorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 36%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 36% to $198 million, or 4.8% of net sales.

Our income tax was $62 million in Q1, or a 30% rate for the quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 30%, and that cash taxes paid will be less than $75 million. However, there's potential for significant volatility due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction, and business acquisitions or investments. We're endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.

GAAP net income was $143 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared with $111 million and $0.26 per diluted share.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash from marketable securities increased $830 million to $2.4 billion year-over-year. Inventory increased 43% to $1.08 billion, and inventory turns improved to 13.1, up from 12.9 in the prior year, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories.

Our investment in net fixed assets increased $152 million from a year ago to $594 million. Our Q1 2008 capital expenditures were $61 million.

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our euro denominated debt to market quarterly, intercompany balances in foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates approximately where they had been recently.

For Q2 we expect net sales of between $3.875 billion and $4.075 billion, a growth of between 34 and 41%. This guidance anticipates approximately 700 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.

GAAP operating income to be between $120 million and $160 million or between 3% growth and 38% growth. This includes approximately $80 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $200 million and $240 million or between 21% growth and 46% growth.

For the calendar year 2008 we expect net sales of between $19.1 billion and $20 billion, a growth between 29 and 35%. This guidance anticipates greater than 400 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.

GAAP operating income to be between $740 million and $940 million or between 13% growth and 43% growth. This includes approximately $285 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.

We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $1.025 billion and $1.225 billion or between 21% growth and 44% growth. Our goal continues to be operating leverage in 2008 with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis.

We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth over time with some variability, including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $300 million.

We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per-share, while investing in our long-term opportunities. We're confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand.

Thanks and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: A couple of questions. First of all, philosophically do you think your customers have a greater propensity to buy or show greater loyalty to your retail business in the third-party? I guess does that influence what the lifetime value of a customer is that is buying across let's say retail or Prime versus the third-party business?

Then second, now that you have rolled out internationally third-party and Prime, are you getting the type of incremental leverage from selection and reduced friction on the e-commerce side that you side in the U.S. I guess over the last year and now you're seeing from an acceleration standpoint?

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: This is Jeff. I will take the first one. I think what our customers are focused on is whether they're getting excellent service in every one of their transactions. Certainly for Amazon Prime numbers we have raised the bar and offer the ability for customers to get product very, very quickly. Very low cycle times from the time they place the order until we're shipping it out our dock door, and then it gets to the customer in two days for free.

What we are working to do with Fulfillment by Amazon is make it possible for third-party sellers to stow their inventory in our fulfillment centers so that we can offer the same level of service to our customers for those third-party items that we do for the Amazon-owned inventory.

We are seeing a lot of traction there. We are seeing a lot of happy sellers with Fulfillment by Amazon. And it is certainly great for customers in part because they can get one box instead of two. So if they order something from Amazon at the same time they order something from a third-party seller, if we have that item in inventory, we get to marry those two items together, shipped them in one box. It is a better customer experience. It saves transportation costs, transportation fuel, and it just works out better.

There is enough systemwide cost savings that we can offer Fulfillment by Amazon to the third-party sellers at a very attractive price. But the driver of that program is with most things we do, starting with how are we going to make that customer experience great? We have this Amazon Prime customer experience and we want that to work for third-party sales and for third-party sellers.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Could you repeat the second part of the question?

JEETIL PATEL: If you look internationally you have rolled out third-party and Prime in some of the major regions over the past year. Are you starting to see that incremental leverage of both selection from your third-party side as well as the reduced friction from Prime helping to drive or accelerate growth as you have been seeing in the U.S.?

TOM SZKUTAK: Certainly with the third-party we have had third-party sellers in international for quite some time, but we have launched some new features of over the past few years with merchants being more prominent in international. But we're very pleased with our third-party sellers in international. It is certainly growing nicely, as well as the total is growing nicely.

In terms of Prime, we're very, very happy with what we are seeing, but it is still very, very early with a few countries just being launched a few months ago, and Japan about nine months ago. We love what we see so far, but it is very early.

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JP Morgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JP MORGAN: Two questions. First international operating income growth rate, excluding foreign currency, decelerated pretty significantly. I was trying to understand how should we think about international gross profit and segment operating income growth rate.

The second question, in the U.S. can you give us some sense like if the U.S. economy slows, or continue to slow, and if you see more price discounting from the other retailers, what kind of pricing you expect? Do you continue to be -- maintain your price leadership? And if so, how should we think about the gross profit dollar growth?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the international operating margins, what you're seeing is if you take a look at it, it is really our gross margins were down year-over-year. And what you're seeing is certainly lower prices in international was a piece of it. Also if you just look at the mix of business, we had very, very strong growth in EGM, electronics and general merchandise. That was up 76% year-over-year. It is going to be 71% year-over-year. Adjusted for FX it was up 56%, which is the strongest growth we have seen in quite some time in international.

If you think about it, if you look at a lot of the category launches that we have had, we have had approximately 16 category launches last year. So again, a lot of these newer categories are starting, and we're making sure that we have great prices right away. But we certainly don't have the scale to buy yet in those particular categories. So you're saying part of that.

Also, offsetting some of those impacts of mix and pricing is certainly third-parties growing at a faster rate, as well as COGS reductions. That is really what is happening in international. And we think certainly adding a lot of new categories and that opportunity both for customers and investors of a long time is a good thing. And it is something we will continue to drive.

In terms of the second part, our pricing strategy is very simple. We're going to make sure we have great low prices for customers. It is hard -- certainly hard to predict what will happen over the course of the year, but we think we have reflected what we do think is going to happen in the guidance that we have given today.

But we're going to make sure that we have great prices and great selection. And on top of that -- this wasn't part of your question -- but we think that in this type of environment externally customers want great value. So that is both in down times and up times. So I think that is good, and so we are going to concentrate and make sure we have the right processes in place to make sure we have the right prices for customers.

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Credit Suisse.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: I was wondering if you could give us an update on the third-party business in Europe, particularly with your ability to attract the larger third-party partners like Marks & Spencer, and of course Target in the U.S.? You mentioned that third-party is 31% of overall business. That number has been pretty very stable for a while despite the launch into Europe. Can you give us an idea of what kind of impact Europe is having, and if there is some kind of offset in the U.S. that is holding that number at 30%?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of our -- we haven't broken out separately the two segments, but the third-party business is doing very well in both segments. So I can't help you much with the international piece, but just a few data points on our total business, which includes international.

You mentioned our third-party units were actually 30%, which is up from last year, Q1 of last year. Also our active seller accounts, which includes some that globally, we had 8% growth last year Q1. We have 17% growth this quarter. So we are seeing nice active seller growth. And again that is a global number. And we have had several quarters of sequential growth, including growing from Q4.

We are seeing a lot of positives from our third-party business. And as Jeff mentioned a few minutes ago, some of the things we are doing with Fulfillment by Amazon is also very promising again to try to make that experience better for both customers and sellers.

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Stifel Nicolaus.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Could you talk a little bit about your digital initiatives in your international markets in terms of timing? I understood that you have certain plans within Europe in 2008, and was wondering if you can add some clarity around that.

Separately, just a bigger picture item. Your long-term ambitions with payments, the Amazon payment site is live. You have launched Flexible Payments, and also done an investment in Bill Me Later. It would be interesting to understand what your long-term plans are there.

TOM SZKUTAK: What we did say for international in Q3 it would be some time this year. So we don't have anything more to add to that. In terms of the second part of your question, could you repeat it -- it was Scott, right, that had the question?

SCOTT DEVITT: The second part is just around your third-party payment initiatives with the Amazon payment site that allows the bank account transfers as well as balances, and the Flexible Payments system, which allows developers to integrate into e-commerce sites, and your Bill Me Later investment, I am trying to understand what your ambitions are with each of those platforms.

JEFF BEZOS: It is certainly -- beyond what we have announced we think these are very interesting initiatives. It is still very early in all of them. And we think that we can offer very good customer experience, which will be for both developers and customers ultimately. We will have to -- you have to stay tuned to see more on those.

OPERATOR: Dave Joseph, Morgan Stanley.

DAVE JOSEPH, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: As you have increased your revenue guidance for 2008, you have also kept your operating income the same. In other words, your guidance for margin came down a little bit. Our sense is that it is a little bit more of the same, greater -- lower pricing in international, stronger EGM mix, but also are there -- were there increased expectation for spending as well?

Also, in terms of the economy it sounds like you're really not seeing anything in terms of an impact to consumer spending. I am just wondering if we could be a little bit even more granular. If you saw anything during the quarter, or even in April, related to units -- related to conversion or even units sold per customer or lower ticket sizes, maybe softness in certain categories that you may have observed that could be related to the economy?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question about the increase in revenue and operating income, or CSOI, being the same as what it was before, I wouldn't read much into it. It is largely unchanged from 90 days ago. But in terms of what we are seeing externally, we don't have a lot of data points on the economy. We have certainly a lot of data points on how our business is doing. As you can see from our results in Q1, revenue growth, as well as operating margin -- we had strong revenue growth as well as good operating improvements year-over-year, with operating margins up approximately 30 basis points. That is what we have seen in Q1. What we think will happen throughout the year has been reflected in the guidance that we gave you today.

OPERATOR: Jeffrey Lindsay, Sanford Bernstein.

JEFFREY LINDSAY, ANALYST, SANFORD BERNSTEIN: We wanted to ask and see if we could get an update, if it all possible, on sales taxes? Will Amazon be able to cope with collecting sales taxes if obliged to do so by the states, especially New York?

And then also if you could, could you give us any updates that you can on sales of fresh groceries and wine sales? Is this still a novelty or do you expect to get any traction here?

TOM SZKUTAK: It would be early to comment on any state activity, but -- as it relates to sales taxes. But certainly we do collect sales tax or a value-added tax in the states or countries that require us to do so. We do that activity approaching 50% of our total business, we do collect some type of sales tax or value-added tax.

We have great businesses in those states and countries that we do do that. The reason why we do is because we're focused on the things that matter to customers, which is making sure that we do have great prices, that we are continuing to expand selections, making sure that we have more and more products in stock and available for immediate shipment. Those are the things that matter to customers, and so that is what we're doing.

In terms of some of your other questions, in terms of groceries we have really two things that we do. We have a consumable business today which is a dry goods business that we are very pleased with. It is still very early, but we think we like what we see so far.

In terms of the other part of this we do have a small pilot going on related to fresh groceries. It is in the Seattle area. Here locally we were testing groceries. But beyond that again is just a test that we're doing, and we will see how that works out.

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: A few things. Jeff, I saw your interview on the Kindle and I sensed the Company's excitement there. Any media sales either through the Kindle or some of the stuff you're doing in music or video affecting results, either revenues or margins at all at this point?

A second question, we saw the other revenues really tick up. I think they were growing close to 40%. Is that anything to do with Web Services?

And finally, Tom, could you just remind us what your currency guidance was back in January? I believe it was 400 basis points for the year. At this point I just want to remind us where it was when you guided in January.

TOM SZKUTAK: It was 200 basis points in January and now what is 400. In terms of digital, we are extremely happy with what we're able to offer customers. But certainly we have a considerable base of revenue today. It is very, very early but we're very pleased with traction in each of the initiatives that we have out there. And I apologize for not breaking it out in any more detail than that.

JUSTIN POST: On the other, what drove the growth year-over-year?

TOM SZKUTAK: Other is a combination of a number of things, including some of our Amazon Enterprise Services. Certainly Web Services would be a part of that as well. And so again there's a number of things that are included in that.

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citigroup.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Two or three questions please. The ROIC trend, that 32%, clearly up on a year-over-year basis, but since it is a trailing four or five quarters calculation, is there any particular reason why it would have legged down from the 50% levels, or materially higher for the last couple of quarters?

Then secondly, just in terms of the overall revenue mix or product mix, are you seeing any trend -- material trend towards purchases of staple items, consumer staple items on your site, away from maybe more traditional media, entertainment, consumer discretionary items?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question related to ROIC, what you're seeing is certainly versus last quarter free cash flow was very strong. But wasn't as strong as it was on a trailing twelve-month basis ended 2007, which is certainly a key driver. A lot of that is just really seasonality associated with our business as it relates to our operating cycle, which you can see.

In terms of -- can you repeat the second part of your question related to consumables? I didn't quite --.

MARK MAHANEY: Are you seeing amongst the Amazon customer base a shift towards or an increasing of the basket or the bundle as people check out that includes more consumer staple items, the simple things, the toothpaste, the hairbrushes, things like that? Is there something in there that indicates that increasing wallet share is coming not just from cross-selling media, consumer electronics, but actually cross-selling consumer staples?

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm sorry. There's not really a lot I can comment on that. Again, what we're seeing though is, if you look at our results, you are seeing very broad strong growth across the key sales breakouts that we have. And that is not just globally, you are saying it in the individual segments. You are seeing strong media growth as well as EGM in both segments. And so you should be thinking about that it is very broad.

MARK MAHANEY: One last question. It has to do with any recessionary impact. I know you have been kind of asked about this before, but just to be clear, is your position that you are not seeing any impact from the recessionary environment in the U.S., either in terms of demand for certain categories, demand for certain price points, or that you are, and if you are, how are you seeing that impact?

TOM SZKUTAK: What we are seeing is -- you can see at -- based on the results that we have just published in Q1, globally our revenue increased 37%. You see that in both segments, excluding the impact of exchange rates, both grew faster than 30%. Which is -- which we think is very strong. It was very broad, as I mentioned.

So it is difficult to say. We don't have lot of data points around the economy, so it is difficult to say what is going on there. We are seeing -- what we see within our business, which is some pretty good strengths across categories.

Again, we think it is driven by a lot of things that we talked about earlier. It is is making sure, continuing to have great low prices, increasing our selection, making sure that we also have in-stock levels where we want them to be. We have been improving that a lot over the past few years. So those are the things that are driving the growth.

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth, Lehman Brothers.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: First, media sales have been strong for some time, but it looks like there has been a more material deceleration in 1Q in the U.S. Is there anything in particular that you would attribute that to?

Then secondly, can you just confirm is Audible now factored into the guidance? Was in factored in three months ago? And how much are you expecting from Audible in '08?

TOM SZKUTAK: It is factored into our guidance. It was not factored into our guidance 90 days ago. We're not breaking out the detail of what that is for 2008. But in terms of our overall growth in media, we are actually pleased with it. North America was 21% growth -- excuse me, it was 22% growth, 21% ex FX. If you go back to Q1 last year it was 21%.

So we're still seeing strong growth in international. We also had 22% growth ex exchange. So again, we're still very pleased with the growth rates we are seeing there.

DOUG ANMUTH: Tom, can you also just provide some color on the increase in stock-based come for the year?

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. The pieces -- we did increase both stock-based comp and intangibles. Keep in mind that we did have the acquisition of Audible, and so there's a piece of that that is amortization of intangibles, which is Audible related, and there's a piece that is stock related. Essentially it is related to forfeitures on the stock-based comp side is the largest piece.

OPERATOR: Aaron Kessler, Piper Jaffray.

AARON KESSLER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: I have got a couple of questions. First, going back to the economy, any sense, are people changing maybe their average order sizes or any impact you are seeing maybe from larger ticket items?

And also in terms of seasonality throughout the quarter can you comment at all on how that may have changed? It seems like it got a little slower in March than it was in January and February. So any commentary on seasonality throughout the quarter.

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the economy, I'm not sure if I can add a lot more to it. We saw -- you know, we thought was strong growth in Q1. We thought it was pretty broad based, across categories. We feel good about it. It is certainly -- 31% growth is not the growth that we aw in Q4 -- 31% ex exchange. It was 37% in Q4. But we're certainly overlapping some pretty good growth rates back in Q1 of last year.

Despite that, we actually -- if you compare our growth rate in Q1 on a dollar basis or ex exchange, we had an acceleration from Q1 of last year. And you could argue that the economic environment, at least what I'm reading as well as I'm sure what you're reading, looks tougher. So not as strong as Q4, but certainly stronger than we saw in Q1 last year, an acceleration. And again it is cross categories. We feel good and it is broad based.

AARON KESSLER: Just a quick follow-up. Revenues seem to be growing much faster than unit growth, where they use to grow closer to in line. Is that just an EBITDA shift to electronics and other category or is there another reason for that?

TOM SZKUTAK: Can you repeat the question again?

AARON KESSLER: Revenues seemed to be growing faster than unit growth over the last few quarters, where they use to grow more in line. Is that just a shift really to the electronics and other category from more BMV?

TOM SZKUTAK: I would look -- I would actually make sure you are taking out the impact of exchange when you look at it, because certainly exchange is impacting us quite a bit. Again, our growth rate for units this quarter was 31%. Our revenue ex exchange was 31%, and again 37% on a dollar basis.

OPERATOR: James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.

JAMES MITCHELL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much for taking a couple of questions. The first one, is it reasonable to assume from the jump in unearned revenue that that would to some extent reflect sales of Kindles and Prime payments?

TOM SZKUTAK: You are breaking out a little bit. Could you repeat the question again please?

JAMES MITCHELL: I'm sorry. If I look at the jump in unearned revenue on the unearned revenue inflows on the cash-flow statement, would that reflect sales of Kindle and Prime payments increasing?

TOM SZKUTAK: It has a number of things that would be included in that, but certainly those elements would be included in there, yes.

JAMES MITCHELL: And then the fact that the general and admin costs, that they seem very well controlled in the latest quarter. Should we expect that trend to broadly continue going forward, that tick down from roughly 2% to roughly 1% of revenue?

TOM SZKUTAK: It has been a relatively small percentage of revenue over some time, and we're not giving guidance on any particular line items. But I'm not sure I can help you much with that one. Apologies.

JAMES MITCHELL: Finally, for me, on the gross margin trends, if you look internally at gross margin trends within categories, can you provide any color on whether the recent flattening in gross margins year-on-year is do more to price reductions within categories or to category mix shift from higher gross margins to lower gross margin categories?

TOM SZKUTAK: The way the dynamics I guess of thinking about gross margins, the way I would describe it would be this. We're not breaking out individual categories. But certainly we're trying to make sure we are as competitive as possible. That is on each item and each of the categories that we have globally. Offsetting that, we certainly are continuing to try to make sure we get good COGS reductions from suppliers.

You should assume that will when we launch new categories that generally those are lower gross margins. So in other words, we're trying to price our products day one competitive, but we don't have the buying ability to -- or the scale to buy at certain prices from vendors who don't have the volume. But certainly that changes over time.

Then as these individual categories get more traction, usually there is a better third-party representation of those categories. I don't know that is helpful. It doesn't quite answer your question, but I think directionally hopefully it does.

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Banc of America Securities.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: In terms of your guidance, are you factoring in, or do you expect any impact form the U.S. economic stimulus plan rebate?

And just separately, any comments on why the Kindle remains supply constrained?

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of our guidance, we factored in certainly all things that we can think of that will impact our business, leading up to the call. And so we look at recent trends. We have our -- categories provide forecasts of our business globally. We have a number of a different models. So all of those things we try to take into account when we give guidance.

JEFF BEZOS: I can comment on Kindle. The team here has worked incredibly hard since launch to increase the supply chain to increase manufacturing capacity. And they are doing a very good job at that. Just as of a couple of days, Kindle is where we have always wanted it to be, which is in-stock. So We're very excited about that. We have worked hard to get that Kindle detail page to say availability, in stock.

OPERATOR: Steve Weinstein, Pacific Crest.

STEVE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST: This I think it has been asked a lot of ways, so (technical difficulty) a little more directly. If I look at your guidance for the full year, if I take into account the change in currency assumptions, the acquisition of Audible on the upside for Q1, it looks like you're guiding down revenue for the next three quarters by about 3%. I'm wondering if that reflects any change you're seeing in the demand environment, or if that reflects tactical changes that Amazon has planned for the rest of the year?

TOM SZKUTAK: I wouldn't read too much into it. We have certainly raised our guidance. If you look at the bottom end of the range for our guidance for revenue it reflects certainly some changes in currency and the acquisition that you mentioned.

I wouldn't read too much into it. We still -- the most recent performance that we have is Q1. And we thought we had very strong performance, both on the revenue growth and operating profit standpoint. We feel good about the business and -- but based on our best forecast for the year, we think the guidance is appropriate.

ROB ELDRIDGE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Good day everyone and welcome to the  Amazon.com fourth quarter 2007 financial results teleconference. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks I will be turning the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, [Mr. Rob Eldridge]. Please go ahead, sir.   

ROB ELDRIDGE, VP IR,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 '07 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.   

   TD
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 30, 2008 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2006 annual report on Form 10-K.   

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.   

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.   

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2006. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.   

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: This was another successful year for  Amazon.com. Let me start by reviewing 2007 financial results. Free cash flow grew 143% to $1.18 billion. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 435 million shares, compared with 436 million shares. Return on invested capital was 55%, up from 28%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities, over five quarter ends.   

Revenue grew 39% to $14.84 billion, or 35% excluding the $399 million favorable impact from the year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. This was our fastest annual growth rate since 2000.   

North America revenue grew 38% to $8.1 billion, and international grew 39% to $6.74 billion, 31% year-over-year, excluding the year-over-year changes in FX. Additionally, EGM revenues surpassed $3 billion in North America and $2 billion in international for the first time.   

Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, grew 70% to $849 million, or 64% excluding $29 million of favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin increased 105 basis points to 5.7%. GAAP operating income grew 69% to $655 million, or 4.4% of net sales.   

Now I will discuss the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue grew 42% to $5.67 billion, or 37% excluding the $195 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $3.33 billion, up 33%, or 28% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $2.21 billion, up 58%, or 54% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 39% of worldwide sales, up from 35%. Worldwide unit growth was 33%. Active customer accounts exceeded 76 million, up 19%.   

Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately 1.3 million, up 15%. Seller units were 26% of total units versus 25%. Worldwide gross profit was $1.17 billion, up 38%. Gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 20.6%, primarily due to lowering prices for customers and changing product mix, partially offset by increases in our seller business.   

Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensations. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $842 million, or 14.8% of sales, an improvement of 75 basis points year-over-year. Tech and content was $190 million, or 3.4% of revenue, compared with 4.1%.   

Now we will talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment revenue grew 40% to $3.08 billion, outpacing last year Q4 growth of 31%. Media revenue grew 31% to $1.64 billion, where we saw increases in all categories.   

EGM revenue grew 53% to $1.34 billion, representing 43% of North America revenues, up from 40%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes, and sporting goods. North American gross profit grew 31% to $698 million, and gross margin decreased 143 basis points to 22.6%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 25% to $153 million, a 5% operating margin. In the international segment revenue grew 46% to $2.59 billion. Revenue growth was 35%, adjusting for the $188 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter.   

Media revenue grew 36% to $1.69 billion, or 26% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $877 million, or 55% excluding FX. This was the fastest growth rate for international EGM in more than two years. EGM now represents 34% of international revenues, up from 29%.   

International gross profit grew 48% to $472 million, or grew 37% excluding foreign exchange rates, while gross margin increased 32 basis points to 18.2%, reflecting an increase in sales of products by sellers, partially offset by lowering prices to customers, including free shipping and changes in product mix.   

International segment operating income increased 65% to $175 million, a 6.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international operating income increased 49%. CSOI grew 44% to $328 million, or 5.8% of revenue, up 6 basis points. The year ago quarter included an $8 million insurance recovery benefit in G&A. Excluding this benefit CSOI for the quarter would have grown 49%, and then up 26 basis points.   

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 38% to $271 million, or 4.8% of net sales.   

Our income tax expense was $74 million in Q4, or a 26% rate for the quarter, which includes a $4 million benefit adjusted to reflect our annual effective tax rate of 28%. In 2007 we paid $24 million in cash taxes. The majority of our tax expense is non-cash because we have current tax benefits and NOLs related to excess stock-based compensation.   

We expect our effective tax rate in 2008 to be approximately 30%. And we estimate cash taxes paid to be less than $75 million. However, there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and business acquisitions or investments.   

We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.   

GAAP net income was $207 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared with $98 million and $0.23 per diluted share.   

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.2 billion to $3.31 billion. In Q1 '07 we repurchased $248 million of our common stock, or 6 million shares. Inventory increased 37% to $1.2 billion. And inventory turns were flat at 12.7, even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies, and introduced new product categories.   

Our investment in net fixed assets increased $86 million from a year ago to $543 million. Our 2007 capital expenditures were $224 million.   

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there's a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.   

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our euro denominated debt to market quarterly, intercompany balances and foreign currencies that settle among subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material impact effect on guidance.   

Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangibles, any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring related estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.   

For Q1 we expect net sales of between $3.95 billion and $4.15 billion, a growth of between 31 and 38%. This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact of foreign exchange.   

GAAP operating income to be between $155 million and $200 million, or between 7% growth and 38% growth. This includes approximately $55 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.   

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $210 million and $255 million, or between 17% growth and 42% growth.   

For calendar 2008 we expect net sales of between $18.75 billion and $19.75 billion, growth of between 26 and 33%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.   

GAAP operating income to be between $785 million and $985 million, or between 20% growth and 50% growth. This includes approximately $240 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.   

We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $1.025 billion and $1.225 billion, or between 21% growth and 44% growth. We intend to continue to get operating leverage during 2008 with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis.   

We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability including some changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $300 million.   

We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per-share, while investing an our long-term opportunities. We're confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well as our free cash flow, will expand.   

Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.   

ROB ELDRIDGE: Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.   

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Brian Pitz,  Bank of America.

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, BANK OF AMERICA: I think the question on everyone's mind is how should we begin to conceptualize the 20 basis points of margin expansion that is at the midpoint of your guidance for 2008, despite a really significant year-over-year revenue increase?   

It would seem as if you should be able to drive somewhat better margins, given this type of growth. And what is driving it? Is it Prime, higher overall costs of shipping, any additional color would be really helpful. Thanks.   

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. We have given in terms of the guidance that we have given for the total year, you have a range certainly in terms of implied operating margins. If you take the low end of the guidance from a CSOI perspective and the high-end, it is a range of 5.5 to 6.2%. And that compares to 5.7% in 2007. Again, it is a range.   

But certainly as you think about our business in 2008, we're going to do more of the same that we did in 2007. We're going to make sure that we focus on the customer experience, which includes making sure that we have great prices across all of our categories and geographies. And you saw that reflected in our Q4 results. We are going to continue to make sure that we have increased selection, have great in-stock levels. So all those things are included in the guidance that we have given.   

We're going to obviously still continue to invest appropriately, which is reflected in the guidance. The other aspect that you see, because you see an effect that is essentially flat operating margins in Q4, and certainly one of the bigger drivers of that is the gross margin year-over-year decline. With the great growth rate that we saw in Q4, when that happens good things happen to us. And what I mean by that, there's an opportunity to go to and work with our supplier base, our vendors, to get even better, better prices. That is something that is certainly an opportunity for us. And with the broad breadth of growth that we had across categories in all of our geographies, it is clearly an opportunity for us.   

OPERATOR: Heath Terry,  Credit Suisse.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: To follow-up on what Brian was asking, how does this affect, and to what extent does it affect the long-term margin guidance that you have given of being able to get to 10% margins in the business?   

As you continue to take the incremental profit dollars that you're getting and plow them back into topline to drive growth, at what point do you allow some of that margin -- or how do you think about timing the allowance of some of that margin to actually flow to the bottom line, or is this going to be an ongoing process and we see 6% forever?   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of our expectation, nothing has changed. What we have said in the past is we think that double-digit operating margins are possible. But we're really focused on is driving free cash flow and free cash flow per share. You can see that evidenced in our 2007 results, total year as well as Q4.   

Again, nothing has changed. We have also said that we think that double-digits is possible, but it is a high single digit operating margin is the right thing to drive free cash flow, that is what we will do. If you look at our Q4 results and take a look at it, you saw very strong growth. You saw operating margins that were flat year-over-year, but still strong operating profit growth. And then free cash flow was more than double year-over-year.   

Again, we're focused on driving free cash flow per share. It is certainly our intention to improve operating leverage during 2008, and over time we think that we can improve our operating margins as well.   

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt,  Stifel Nicolaus.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Just on the same subject, but a little bit more detailed, the international gross margin in the quarter on a year-over-year basis was actually up, so the decline was in the domestic margins. There are a lot of moving parts in your gross margin numbers related to these volume price trade-offs that you talk about, but also the product mix in the direct business and then the benefit from third-party sales. I was just wondering if you could talk about whether third-party mix is becoming a less relevant driver of gross margin in the domestic business, and so possibly pricing decisions and the mix shift towards EGM and the direct business is maybe what is pressuring the domestic gross margin? Thank you.   

TOM SZKUTAK: Our seller business globally is very strong. We're continuing to try to work on that experience for sellers to make it even better. Certainly our goal is to have sellers increase their sales on our platform. So we continue to do a number of different things to make it easier for them to sell, including FDA. Again, we are pleased with our seller business. And I don't know if that answers your question. Was there a second part -- I mean a second question?   

SCOTT DEVITT: The second part is I'm just wondering how much the mix shift towards EGM, which I believe is lower margin than the historical BMV direct business, if that is driving the domestic margins down a bit -- the mix shift?   

TOM SZKUTAK: I would probably describe the margin structure more like this. We have -- and this is globally -- we have entered into a lot of new categories over the past few years. And when we enter those new categories we are pricing very competitively day one, making sure we have great prices for customers.   

It takes us a while to get the scale on those individual categories, in those geographies. When that happens is -- certainly you should expect that very oftentimes when we have a newer category that those are lower gross margins. And then as we get the scale in those individual categories, good things happen. We get more traffic, which helps our third-party business. It also helps us get better prices with our suppliers.   

That is one of the reasons why we're excited about what we have seen throughout the course of 2007 and in Q4, is that we have gotten great growth. And now the opportunity that we have in front of us is how do we again work better with, even more closely, with suppliers to get better prices. That is something that is not an immediate thing. It is just something that evolves over time as we continue to grow. It is a good opportunity for us.   

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citi.   

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Two questions. First, on the topline question, are you seeing any signs of consumer softness in spending? You organically showed revenue growth acceleration. It seemed to fly in the face of what most in-store retailers are seeing. Obviously, there is secular growth on the Internet. But are you seeing anything perhaps in the March quarter that indicate softness or maybe a mix shift to lower-priced products?   

Secondly, a quick question for you Jeff. Last quarter you said that you didn't think R&D cycles going forward would have the same step function impact on margins that they had between '04 and '06. Is any of the '08 guidance, is there an implication in there that there is another major R&D cycles coming? Thank you.   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the economic piece, as you can see from results our business is fine. So we really can't add much in terms of the economic piece.   

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER, CEO,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: To your second question, I think what you are referring to is that we've said over the last year or so that we expect to grow into fixed expense that we very deliberately built in 2005 and the first part of 2006.   

Our intention at this point is to continue to demonstrate to ourselves this business model. And so as Tom said, we intend to continue to get operating leverage during 2008 with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis.   

TOM SZKUTAK: Along with that as it relates to technology and content, we certainly would expect the technology and content growth to be somewhat less than revenue growth for 2008.   

JEFF BEZOS: And we believe we can do that with respect to the step function part of your question. We believe we can do that while continuing to make investments in our digital businesses, in Amazon Kindle, in new category expansion. Continue to invest in China as we're doing. Fulfillment by Amazon and our seller business. We have -- our Amazon Web Services business is another area of investment for us. So when we look at -- that is what we mean by not necessarily having to take the same kind of step function increase that you saw in 2005 and the first part of 2006.   

OPERATOR: David Joseph,  Morgan Stanley.

DAVID JOSEPH, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: It seems that you saw active customers accelerate again, and active revenue per customer accelerate as well as units accelerated again to 33% year-over-year. Our guess, our ongoing assumption is a lot of this is coming through Amazon Prime, not only because that is where you have free shipping, but that is also where 1-Click shopping is merchandised pretty effectively. I am just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color in terms of where this incremental growth is coming from, where the acquisition, where the activity is coming from? Is it really coming through Amazon Prime mainly, or is there something else that we might be missing here?   

Also, in terms of the Kindle, can you give us an idea of what we can be expecting from that in 2008? Not necessarily -- I mean, if you could provide any kind of information in terms of units or revenue growth, but also what can we expect in terms of the margins? Should we expect some pressure to Amazon's margins from the Kindle?   

JEFF BEZOS: The growth that we are seeing is broad based. It is coming from different geographies, different categories, different service offerings. So it is not any one particular thing. Certainly Amazon Prime is a component of it. It is -- it continues to be a successful program. One of the reasons that Fulfillment by Amazon is an important program for our seller customers is that it drives -- the number one thing that sellers want is sales, and Fulfillment by Amazon drives sales for sellers.   

When a seller switches to Fulfillment by Amazon, their sales increase. And one of the reasons for that is that those items, those third-party items immediately become eligible for Amazon Prime. Prime members can use their Amazon Prime memberships to buy third-party items as soon as that seller joins Fulfillment by Amazon. We shipped 0.5 million items in the fourth quarter on behalf of third-party sellers through Fulfillment by Amazon. So we're very excited about that investment.   

DAVID JOSEPH: Can you give us a little color on the Kindle?   

JEFF BEZOS: Kindle, in terms of demand, is outpacing our expectations, which is certainly something that we're very grateful for. It is also on the manufacturing side causing us to scramble. We're working very hard to increase the number of units that we can build and supply per week so that we can get back -- our goal is to get into a situation as quickly as we can where when you order a Kindle we ship it immediately. That is the standard we want to hold ourselves to. And we're working very hard to get their. We're super excited by the very strong demand.   

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel,  Deutsche Bank.

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: A couple of questions. User and unit growth accelerated again. Can you just talk about how much of this improvement is being driven by, I guess, price elasticity that is utilizing on your retail business versus mirror services such as third-party out there, or initiatives such as Prime?   

The second question on Kindle, it looks like there is a lot of internal components from kind of build standpoint. It seems to be quite rich from a feature set standpoint. Are there capabilities that have yet to be turned on, beyond just the ebook reader and browser functionality inside the Kindle at this point?   

JEFF BEZOS: The Kindle has a few experimental features that are -- some of which are visible on the Kindle. It has something called NowNow, where you can type in any question, and using the Mechanical Turk in the background, just one of our Web Services, that question get answered. And the answer to the question get displayed on the Kindle. There is an experimental Web browser on the Kindle, which is actually for a mobile device a pretty good Web browser. And of course it has the Whispernet EVDO connectivity, which gives you broadband wireless access to that Web browser.   

There are a number of experimental features. We have put those on there and made them accessible to customers, so that these early Kindle users can tell us what they think of those features, whether we should continue to invest in them, continue to work on them and make them part of the product.   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question related to the growth in units, as I have mentioned, the third-party or the seller percentage grew year-over-year. So seller units were growing at a faster rate. That gets back to some of our comments Jeff just made a minute ago about what we're doing to improve the seller experience.   

Then on the retail side, it is a lot of things we have been talking about. It is again the focus areas are value proposition, making sure we have great prices for customers, selection, convenience and in-stock levels.   

JEETIL PATEL: Do you think it is actually the retail business and your pricing that is helping to accelerate the unit growth and user growth, or do you think it is more the third-party selection side?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, both are very strong, and certainly pricing is a key, but there is a lot of other key factors, including Prime, where customers are getting an increased share of wallet. A number of different factors, and the fact that when customers come to our website now more is in stock than it was 12 months ago or 24 months ago. So when that happens it certainly there is a benefit from doing that, as well as a lot of the other things that we talked about.   

So it is (multiple speakers) selection expansion. Exactly. It is very -- it is a lot of things we have been talking about. They are really over the past several years, but we have continued to be focused on them, and it is showing up in our topline.   

JEETIL PATEL: If I may ask just a quick follow-up? But I guess the longer-term theme at Amazon has been that you would use price as a way to drive growth in the business. And the idea was that you could always lower price because of the cost advantages that you have, and the efficiencies that you're getting from economies of scale. Are you at a point now vis-a-vis retail that you can drive prices lower, and it is helping to accelerate the growth, and you could always use that lever to control the growth of your overall business as a whole? Or do you think it is still going to take maybe a couple of years to have that type of capability relative to the retail formula, which is prices will tend to go higher in general because of the inflationary aspects of retail and real estate?   

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm not sure if this directly answers your question or not, I think it does. One of the things that is clearly the case, and we have observed it over a number of years now, is that in certain categories we are seeing less elasticity from price reductions. That is something that you would expect to see happen, because price elasticity curves are not linear. There is an elbow in the curve right around where competitive prices are. You see a lot of elasticity as you lower prices to meet competitive pricing. You don't see very much elasticity if you go below competitive pricing.   

Our focus has always been to be extremely competitive, and to get really operationally great at that so that our pricing is very, very sharp. And we're always giving customers the best possible deal. At the same time to -- because we have the scale to have a very efficient cost structure -- to be able to do that in a sustainable way that is healthy for the business.   

And you can have a very nice flywheel there where the scale of the Company increases, which allows us to be more efficient, to make better use of both our fixed costs and to do more to drive down variable costs, including, as Tom mentioned, in some of our newer categories where we haven't been operating as long, we're still getting to know the vendors in those categories, getting to know our suppliers, figuring out how to work most efficiently with them. And we will continue to do that.   

There are big opportunities in -- for us, the way we look at this is lowering prices is easy. Being able to afford to lower prices is what is difficult. We have been working on that for many, many years now, and we expect to continue to work on it for our entire corporate existence. And we know of lots of opportunities to improve our fixed costs, to improve our variable costs, and to improve our COGS through working together with our supplier base.   

Those opportunities exist in even our -- even the categories that we have been doing business in the longest. We still have opportunities in there. In our newer categories we have very -- a lot of low hanging fruit. There is more obvious pieces just because they're newer and we haven't done as much in those areas.   

OPERATOR: Robert Peck,  Bear Stearns.

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: A quick question -- two parts on guidance going forward. EBay made some announcements the other day regarding changes to its platform, which is hoping to bring back some of the third-party sellers. Is our current guidance right now accounting for any sort of impact by  eBay, or do you think there will be any impact by  eBay? And then I got one follow-up.   

TOM SZKUTAK: We have a long-standing practice of not talking about any specific company, but as it relates to our business, we have been and continue to be in a very competitive environment, and that is both online and off-line. That is not anything new. It is something that we have been operating in for quite some time.   

The way we address that is we focus on the customer. And we have a number of different customers. We have certainly our direct customer that we're always trying to make sure we improve that experience. We have our sellers, which we view as partners and customers, and we're trying to improve that experience as well. Jeff gave some great examples of that, as well as our developers. We are kind of heads down focused on improving customer experience. And that is what we have been doing and that is what we plan on doing going forward.   

ROBERT PECK: If you started to see an impact, would you think about reducing your take rate for third-party sellers?   

TOM SZKUTAK: I would just say that this is such an intensely competitive environment, and it has been from the very beginning. We have lots of competitors, so it is -- for us the way we think about our seller business, since that is the business you're asking about, is we think of our sellers as a customer set. We try to figure out what they want, and we try to figure out how to give it to them.   

We know that the number one thing that sellers want is sales. We also know that the market that we operate in, and we're very grateful for this fact, is a very, very large one. And in our view, and we have always said this, and I don't think it is going to change, is that there is room for lots of winners. So we have a strategy that we're very, very focused on. We are not changing it. We like our strategy. We're just going to stay heads down.   

And one of the great examples I can give you for trying to drive sales for sellers is the combination of Fulfillment by Amazon and Amazon Prime. I talked about this just a couple of minutes ago. But it is a very good combination for sellers. As sellers continue to signup for Fulfillment by Amazon, and as our buyer customers continue to signup for Amazon Prime, that combination is going to be very good for our buyer customers, and it is going to be very good for our seller customers as well. And we love that.   

ROBERT PECK: Just a quick follow-up on guidance here. Could you talk a little bit about your Borders relationship, and if your guidance in 2008 accounts for any change there?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. The relationship that we have is reflected in the guidance for 2008.   

OPERATOR: Imran Khan,  JPMorgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Two questions. Number one, I was trying to get a better sense about what kind of adoption you're seeing for Prime in the international market. Is it similar to U.S., better than U.S. or weaker than U.S.? Any color would be very helpful.   

And secondly, international gross profit margins still substantially lower than the U.S. gross profit margins. How should we think about that difference to narrow over time? Thank you.   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of international Prime, we're very excited what we are seeing in each of the countries. It is very early, but we like what we see, and we're going to continue to look at all the associated metrics for that program. But we're very pleased to be able to offer it to customers. And we would like what we see so far.   

In terms of the gross margins, you're right that our gross margins on international are less than North America. Keep in mind that certainly our international segment has a number of different countries. And again, there is nothing really structurally different between the two segments, if you will, and so there is really opportunities to improve those margins over time.   

What we have said in the past is certainly our seller business, if you will, is -- we're pleased with globally, but we have certainly a bigger penetration in our in North America segment than we do in international. So that is an opportunity for us. It is an opportunity in both segments, if you will, but certainly we are pleased with what we see there.   

Again, if you think about also in international, if you look back, we have launched many new categories over the past year and over the past few years. And again it goes back to some of my comments that started the call. As those categories get larger and we get more traffic to those categories, it helps third-party business. It also helps from an opportunity to work closely with suppliers to get better -- to work better with them to improve those prices as well. Again, that is certainly what we're working on. And that is what you're seeing in our results.   

IMRAN KHAN: If I may ask a follow-up question about the category expansion. I think you talked about as you continue to grow faster than the broader market, you will have better power with the seller -- suppliers come in terms of getting -- improving your gross profit margins. As you continue to expand your category, and some of the categories are lower margins than your core, like media business, do you think you can still maintain the kind of margins that you had in 2007 or 2006?   

TOM SZKUTAK: We have a wide range of categories. When we enter a new category we're focused on, first, is it something that we think we can serve customers well in, something that we can add a lot of value to customers? And also do we think we can generate a lot of free cash flow. We certainly do look at a lot of different characteristics of those categories before entering them. But there certainly are categories -- an example would be diamonds within the jewelry category. That is something where it is possible to have lower gross margins, but have very high contribution profit per unit, for example.   

First, we are optimizing for, from an investor standpoint, for free cash flow and free cash flow per share. The way we do that is by improving the customer experience. Again, it is a -- we will have a mix of different categories, some of which will have higher gross margins and lower gross margins. And our goal is, again, to maximize free cash flow per share over the long term.   

OPERATOR: Jennifer Watson,  Goldman Sachs.

JENNIFER WATSON, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Can you give us some details on the order frequency of Prime users since the introduction of the service, and if incremental Prime members are ordering as frequently as the early adopters?   

TOM SZKUTAK: There's not a lot of data I can share with you, except that certainly Prime customers are buying more. And we're getting an increase share of wallet. They are buying in more categories, so there's a lot of cross shopping that is going on. And that is something that we saw early on when we started Prime, and it is something we continue to see with existing and new customers.   

JENNIFER WATSON: Can you give any sort of indication on renewal rates of Prime memberships?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Other than that is very good, the truth is we're not disclosing the numbers, but the renewal rates are very good, very strong.   

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth,  Lehman Brothers.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: I have two questions. First, can you tell us what is driving your projected 34% increase in CapEx spending in 2008? And how should we think about your free cash flow growth specifically this year?   

Then secondly, it looks like you added 1,200 employees during the fourth quarter. What is the delta there versus the 600 that you added in 4Q '06 in terms of the composition of employees? Thank you.   

TOM SZKUTAK: I will take the employee one first. We did increase our employee base. The largest portion of that was certainly in our operations and fulfillment area, with the growth that we experienced throughout 2007, as well as what you're seeing in Q4. We certainly improved -- increased our staffing level to support that.   

In terms of CapEx, I think you should probably take a look at it versus the incremental revenue that you're seeing. And again it is in support of our overall business as we grow. That is what we're looking at.   

DOUG ANMUTH: Any commentary on what you could grow free cash flow in '08?   

TOM SZKUTAK: We have traditionally not given guidance on free cash flow. But again over time we certainly see that operating profit, as well as with some adjustments for working capital, it tracks pretty nicely. But again, we're not giving specific guidance for 2008 free cash flow.   

OPERATOR: Justin Post,  Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: A couple of questions about your outlook, which I think most people are wondering about. First, it looks like revenue is higher than a lot of people were thinking, but maybe margins lower. Do you anticipate any changes in the mix between third-party units and your own units?   

And then secondly, does your outlook give you room to accelerate either new category launches internationally next year, or new countries or fulfillment centers? What kind of flexibility have you build in there?   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of -- the guidance that we have for 2008 reflects our best view of what is going to happen in 2008. As we talked about earlier, we are still investing -- going to continue to invest in the business, as Jeff highlighted, in a number of key areas. But as part of that we expect it to be appropriate growth in terms of technology and content.   

In terms of some of the other things that you mentioned, you should expect that we're going to expand capacity, as we have over the past few years, to fulfill the demand for the range of guidance that we have given. You should also expect us to launch new categories as well during 2008. So those are things that we're going to continue to focus on.   

In addition to launching new categories, you should expect us to increase selection in our existing categories in each of our geographies. Those are things that we'll continue to work on to make that experience better for customers.   

JUSTIN POST: How about the first-party, third-party ratio, do you expect that to change much next year?   

TOM SZKUTAK: We're not giving guidance on what the mix will look like. And ultimately -- and this is both in 2008 and really any year -- we've view that nothing has changed. And we have said this consistently. Ultimately the customer will decide where that mix ends up. And that is both in the current year and long term.   

What we're focused on this making sure the experience is great for our various customer sets. And we do that. We think we have nice opportunities to grow both our seller business as well as our retail business, along with our other customer set as well.   

JUSTIN POST: Last question, if you may. The other U.S. revenues were up $30 million year-over-year. It looks like some nice growth there. Is that a positive lever for margin driver -- margin -- gross margins? And what is really driving that growth?   

TOM SZKUTAK: We haven't split up the margins of other, but certainly we've got a number of things going into other. But our Amazon Enterprise Solutions business, as we have talked about in the past we launched a number of new merchants, which is certainly helpful. Web Services as well. So again it is a number of different components of that. We also have various marketing arrangements. Sometimes it is higher or lower depending upon the period. So again, there is a number of different things that are going into that line item.   

OPERATOR: Aaron Kessler, Piper Jaffray.   

AARON KESSLER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: A couple of questions. First the marketing costs were up slightly on a year-over-year basis as a percentage of revenues. I just want to see if there's anything specific to that. And then I have one follow-up question.   

TOM SZKUTAK: The marketing has been over the past several years actually in a pretty tight band as a percentage of revenue. And we continue to try to make sure that we make that spend more efficient, so there's nothing -- I don't think there's anything unusual with it.   

AARON KESSLER: Maybe a question for Jeff. In terms of your expectation for the digital media business, obviously a lot of traditional media in terms of books, music, movies is going more to a download basis. And you are clearly getting prepared for that day when you see more of that shift happening. Any sense for when you really start to see more of that shift happen? And what do you think the impact will be on your business, because how much can you offset the lower traditional media sales with your increased digital sales would be the question?   

JEFF BEZOS: Long term we're very optimistic about that, because when media are physical products it makes a lot of sense for a large majority of those sales to happen in the physical world. But as media becomes digital and downloaded and sent around wirelessly, etc., etc., it doesn't make so much sense to buy those in the physical world. So our relative advantage, relative to where the bulk of the sales are today, the bulk of the sales today of course are in the physical world. Our relative advantage over time should improve relative to the physical world. So we're very -- in the long term very excited about it.   

ROB ELDRIDGE: Thank you for joining us on that call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in  Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.   

JEFF BEZOS: Thank you.   

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the  Amazon.com third-quarter 2007 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.   

For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead.   

   TD
KIM NELSON, DIRECTOR OF IR,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2007 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.   

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 23, 2007 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2006 annual report on Form 10-K.   

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.   

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2006.   

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.   

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP, CFO,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Kim. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 118% to $800 million, while the combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was unchanged from a year ago at $435 million. Worldwide revenue grew 41% to $3.26 billion, or 38% excluding the $75 million favorable impact from foreign exchange.   

Q3 2007 revenue benefited by approximately 290 basis points of year-over-year growth from Harry Potter VII sales plus attachments. Media revenue increased to $2.09 billion, up 36% or 32% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $1.08 billion, up 54% or 51% excluding FX. EGM accounted for 33% of worldwide sales in Q3 2007, up from 30% for the same period last year.   

Our worldwide unit growth was 32%, and active customer accounts exceeded 72 million, up 17% year over year. Worldwide gross profit was $762 million, up 39%. Gross margin decreased 45 basis points to 23.4%, primarily due to lowering prices and change in product mix, partially offset by increases in our third-party business. Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.2 million, and third-party units were 32% of total units versus 30% in the prior year. Amazon Prime memberships more than doubled year over year.   

Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $585 million or 18% of sales, an improvement of 273 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $285 million or 8.7% of net sales, down 31 basis points year over year. During the quarter, we opened new fulfillment centers in Phoenix, Arizona and [Cerans], France.   

Technology and content was $181 million or 5.6% of net sales, an improvement of 122 basis points year over year, as we continue to grow into our new level of spending.   

Marketing was $72 million or 2.2% of net sales, an improvement of 51 basis points year over year. In recent years, our marketing spend has been between 2.2% and 2.7% of net sales.   

Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 42% to $1.79 billion. This is the highest growth rate in seven years. Media revenue grew 38% to $1.08 billion. EGM revenue grew 54% to $631 million, representing 35% of North America revenues, up from 33%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, and toys and baby and soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes and sporting goods.   

North America gross profit grew 34% to $460 million, and gross margin decreased 159 basis points to 25.7%, primarily due to lower prices and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 263% to $79 million, a 4.4% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue was $1.47 billion, up 40% or 33% adjusted for the $72 million favorable foreign exchange impact.   

Media revenue grew 33% to $1.01 billion or 27% excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 54% to $448 million or 45% excluding foreign exchange.   

International gross profit grew 47% to $302 million or 39% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 88 basis points to 20.5%, reflecting the increase in third-party mix, partially offset by lower prices and changes in product mix. International segment operating income increased 94% to $98 million or 6.6% operating margin. Excluding the $5 million favorable impact from FX, international operating income increased 81%.   

CSOI grew 145% to $177 million or 5.4% of net sales, up 228 basis points year over year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 207% to $123 million or 3.8% of net sales.   

Our provision for income taxes was $44 million in Q3 or a 35% rate for the quarter, which includes an $8 million year-to-date adjustment to reflect our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate of 29%, which incorporates our strong North America growth. As a reminder, there is potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction.   

In 2007, we anticipate cash paid for income taxes will be approximately $25 million, compared to $15 million in 2006, as we continue to benefit from NOLs inside the United States. NOL utilization is impacted by many factors, including our excess stock-based compensation deductions.   

GAAP net income was $80 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with $19 million and $0.05 per diluted share.   

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities were $1.91 billion, an increase of $690 million year over year. Inventory increased 32% to $970 million, and inventory turns decreased from 13.2 a year ago to 12.4, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories. Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $42 million from a year ago to $491 million.   

Our return on invested capital was 42%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities.   

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.   

As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intercompany balances in foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently.   

For Q4, we expect net sales of between $5.1 billion and $5.45 billion, or growth of between 28% and 37%. This guidance anticipates greater than 300 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $221 million and $291 million, or grow between 12% and 48%. This includes $54 million primarily for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $275 million and $345 million or grow between 20% and 51%.   

For calendar year 2007, we expect net sales of between $14.263 billion and $14.613 billion, or growth of between 33% and 36%. This guidance anticipates greater than 300 basis points of positive impact of foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $605 million and $675 million, or growth of between 56% and 74%. This includes $191 million primarily for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $796 million and $866 million, or grow between 59% and 73%.   

We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with some variability from changes in working capital. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250 million. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand.   

Thanks, and with that, Kim, let's move to questions.   

KIM NELSON: Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?   

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.   

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Looking at the -- call it almost 11 million new customers, or new active customers you've had in the past year, can you discuss whether their purchase frequency or they are buying from you just as voraciously as the previous set of active customers? I guess, what's driving the accelerated growth across the board?   

Then second, can you talk about the broader impact of lower consumer spending you're seeing in your business? Are you seeing any effect, or do you think that perhaps the online side is a little bit more immune to it, given that it seems to be more about pricing as a big driver of why folks buy online in addition to convenience and other factors?   

TOM SZKUTAK: I'll take a second half of the question first. In terms of the impact of consumer spending, I think what you're seeing for us -- we're certainly not a bellwether for the economy, but what you're seeing is customers reacting and responding to just a very good customer experience, continued focus on lower prices, increased selection and, certainly, speed of delivery, with time being a factor. We think that plays well, as reflected in our guidance for Q4, as we enter into the holiday season. So the customer is really going to get a great customer experience again in Q4, as they did in Q3.   

The first part of your question -- we haven't broken out any particular details on active customers, beyond what we mentioned earlier in the comments. So I really can't help you much with that one.   

JEETIL PATEL: But do you think it's more driven by selection that you're seeing the accelerated growth, or do you think it's actually more just the customer or consumer reaction?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, as I mentioned, it's a combination of increased selection. So we've increased selection in the categories that we're in, going much deeper. We've added new categories over time, as you've seen. We continue to get even sharper on pricing, and those are things that we have a constant focus on. We also want to make sure that inventory is there, so that we can get it to customers very fast, which you can see reflected in our turns.   

So all of those things we spend a lot of time on, and that certainly impact the customer experience. That's reflected in the growth rates that you've seen in Q3.   

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto,  Goldman Sachs.

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: After an extended period of investment, you have now gone to a period of, obviously, being able to grow into your expenses and drive very high incremental margins. I was wondering, as you look into 2008, would you characterize that as another year of growing into your expenses and driving continued margin expansion? Or is it a year in which you may have more balanced investment versus improved profitability?   

Then I had a follow-up question for Jeff on the consumer, as it relates to online behavior.   

TOM SZKUTAK: Unfortunately, we're not giving guidance on 2008 today. Consistent with what we've done over the last couple of years, we'll be giving guidance on our next call, after our Q4 earnings.   

But as it relates to technology and content spending, roughly 15 or 18 months ago, we certainly talked about the fact that we had spent the previous two to two and a half years increasing our investment in a number of key areas, and then we said in the second half of last year that that would start to slow down. You saw that most prominently in Q4 of last year, and that continued in the first three quarters of this year, as we have grown into this level of investment.   

So I think certainly that you've seen that to date. I think one of the things you should keep in mind which is a little different than where we were back in 2004, when we started this increase in investment, is our base is bigger. So we can afford to invest with this higher base that we have, more so than we did in 2004.   

So again, we will be sharing guidance for 2008 on our next call, but hopefully that helps.   

JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT, CEO, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: I'll just add to that by saying that the bigger base might allow us to make investments over time with less of a step function change than you've seen in the past.   

ANTHONY NOTO: I was also wondering if you could comment, if you think about Amazon's value proposition for the consumer today versus maybe three years ago, that value proposition has always offered increased selection, better prices and greater convenience. I was just wondering -- what do you think has changed at Amazon vis-a-vis the on-land experience that has resulted in a meaningful widening of that gap?   

JEFF BEZOS: Well, I think it is really just the continuation of those things that you mentioned. So year in and year out, we have been adding categories and adding very significant flexion and depth inside categories. It sometimes surprises people to learn that we continue to do that even in the categories we been involved in the longest, such as books. But we do continue to deepen our categories there.   

Then we also hold -- we've gotten better at managing inventory, so we're more often in stock, which allows us to deliver products to customers much faster. We've also just incrementally, over time, gotten more efficient, gotten better at defect reduction so we can do things accurately for customers at low cost. That has allowed us to continuously lower prices.   

I think it's the combination of those things -- getting products to customers quickly, having the broad selection and the deep selection and having very attractive price points, in combination with free shipping. So that package of things, we have been very, very consistent on for a long time. I don't think there any change is there. I just think that every year, we get a little bit better.   

OPERATOR: David Joseph,  Morgan Stanley.

DAVID JOSEPH, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: I have one question, related to gross margin. It looks like it came down by about 44 basis points year over year, and we did notice that your shipping loss was up nearly about 40%, but it looks like your third-party sellers were actually accelerated. So I'm wondering if there was a one-time impact there from Harry Potter. Then maybe you can also talk a little bit about the contribution from third-party sales.   

Just an additional comment on that, I guess, or question would be fulfillment and G&A. G&A actually declined on an absolute basis. Fulfillment declined on a percentage basis of revenue. Fulfillment might be scale, but can you tell us a little bit about if I'm missing anything or if we're missing anything on fulfillment, but also what might have lead to decline in G&A, too?   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of gross margins, yes, Harry Potter is having an effect. It was slightly less than a contribution profit breakeven event for us. So you should assume that that's a lower gross margin than our average, so is bringing it down. Then, in terms of our overall expense, as you look at our direct segment operating expenses, there's certainly a number of different impacts. But keep in mind, as I was mentioning a few questions ago, in the first three quarters of last year, our direct segment operating expenses in total -- which includes tech and content fulfillment, G&A and marketing -- were growing at a rate that was faster than revenue, and Q3 is no exception to that. So we're getting leverage on each of those line items.   

DAVID JOSEPH: So with the impact to gross margin on Harry Potter, should we expect that to normalize over the next couple of quarters?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, again, we're not giving guidance on those individual line items, but certainly what we expect is reflected in our Q4 guidance, but did have an impact on our Q3 results.   

OPERATOR: Robert Peck,  Bear Stearns.

VICTOR ANTHONY, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: This is actually Victor Anthony in for Robert Peck, who is traveling. Just a few questions. One, I wonder if you could give us an update on your international and expansion plans beyond the six international locations that you have right now? Kind of curious as to what geographies look attractive and any sort of timeframe.   

The second question is really on the international electronics and other general merchandise category. It looks like there was a significant acceleration in revenues on that line, and I was kind of curious as to what is driving that particular acceleration.   

The final question is really on your guidance for 4Q. It looks the pro forma operating margin at the midpoint is really calling for a modest improvement on a year-over-year basis, compared to the sizable jump in this particular third quarter that you just reported. I'm wondering if there's anything of note in that particular quarter in the guidance.   

TOM SZKUTAK: As it relates to the international expansion, we certainly will add new geographies over time, but we certainly think there's a lot of improvement in terms of additional selection that we can add in the geographies that we're in. We really like the geographies that we're in, and in terms of categories today, we're most penetrated in the US right now, and each of the individual geographies outside of the US don't have the same depth that we do in our  Amazon.com website. So that's clearly a focus for us as we add new categories, selection within those existing categories as well as new categories.   

In terms of the other -- you mentioned the EGM growth in international being accelerated this quarter. What's driving that is some of the things that we've been talking about, which is really just fundamentals. It's focusing on -- we have been adding selection. We continue to try to improve the customer experience, making sure that our prices are sharp in all of the geographies and categories that we're in and continue to work on reducing those overall customer-facing defects. So those are the things that are really helping our international EGM growth.   

In terms of guidance, yes, there's -- the implied guidance for CSOI translates into a range of 5.4% on the low side to 6.3% on the high side for operating margins, with the midpoint being at 5.9%, which is up from 5.7% last year.   

Two things to keep in mind -- one is, as you look at last year's results, through the first three quarters, the growth rate for those individual quarters, excluding foreign exchange, were anywhere from 23% to 25%. In Q4, it jumped to 30%, and we've had sizable growth since then, so again, we're overlapping that 30% growth rate.   

The second piece is, as I was mentioning about our direct segment operating expenses growing at a faster rate for the first three quarters of last year, higher than -- was growing at a faster rate than revenue. Q4, our direct segment operating expenses were actually growing at a slower rate than revenue, and we are overlapping that as well. So those two factors, most certainly taking into account as we look at our guidance for Q4.   

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citi Investment Research.   

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITI INVESTMENT RESEARCH: I wanted to ask about the progress or status of some of the digital media offerings. It looks like Unbox is coming up through a couple of iterations, nice healthy improvement in the product and in the user interface. You've had the music service out. Can you quantify at all or give any qualitative comments about what kind of traction you're seeing for those segments? Maybe, just to stress out the negative, are you seeing any signs that that is cannibalizing existing sales of CDs or of DVDs?   

JEFF BEZOS: Well, I would just say that we're very happy with the early results that we're seeing. We're getting terrific feedback from customers. Everybody loves the DRM-free format, so selling MP3s is being very successful for us. We have a lot of initiatives that we continue to work on. One of the things with our MP3 store is -- the way we look at it, the onus is on us to continue to convince music labels that this is a good way to sell their music.   

So we continue to work on that, but we're very happy with the way that it's going. Our approach on this is you get out there and you get started, and you try to figure out what customers want and try to figure out how to give it to them, and then just repeat that consistently over a number of years. So you can count on us to keep working on those things. We're thrilled with the early results from customers.   

MARK MAHANEY: No evidence that it's had any impact on the physical CD or DVDs sales?   

JEFF BEZOS: We haven't seen any evidence of that. I think it's way too early to know whether you would see any of that.   

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Banc of America.   

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA: First, any commentary on the performance or traction of some of your newer, higher-margin categories such as handbags, shoes and/or even auto parts? Then maybe some thoughts on new areas for expansion?   

Then a second unrelated -- just kind of a follow-on to the digital media question before. You're offering this digital locker to store digital books and video downloads. Is it possible for you to add essentially similar features for music downloads as well, down the road?   

JEFF BEZOS: Well, with respect to your last question first, that's exactly the kind of thing that we try to solicit feedback on from customers and see if it would be helpful and, if it is, then work together with our industry partners to try and figure out how to make that happen.   

As far as some of the new categories go, we like the results we see. When we launch a new category, we always good through a period where we have to have significant inventory upfront relative to the early sales, so that's one of the factors that contributes in our corporate-wide inventory turns. But those are very good investments, and what we see is over time, we get very good at managing these new categories.   

What we're initially trying to do when we launch a new category is make sure that the customer experience is good even from the beginning. So we forward-invest in the customer experience in a new category, to make sure that it's going to be acceptable to customers. We try to get better at it, and then we hone the economics in those new categories over time.   

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt,  Stifel Nicolaus.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: The question relates to Merchants@ internationally. I believe the marketplace has been open in the international market for a few years now, so I'm trying to get a better understanding of how significant Merchants@ can be internationally, over time. I was wondering if you could just talk about the mix domestically between Amazon Marketplace for third-party units and Merchants@, just to better understand the dynamics.   

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. As it relates to -- and if you take a look at our international third-party business, we haven't -- as I mentioned in the opening remarks, our total worldwide third-party units as a percentage of total units is 32%. We haven't broken out the details between North America and international, but certainly the North America is more penetrated than international is. But we seeing nice progress in international, in terms of improving as a percentage of third-party units. So we are very pleased with how that part of the business is going, and that's certainly one of the drivers that you see reflected in our gross margins on international.   

In terms of how big it can be, it's a difficult question to answer. What we do is two things. One, we're very focused on trying to improve our overall customer experience, which includes third parties. We're focused on improving the retail side of our business, meaning product that we sell directly, and so we are continuously trying to add selection, add new categories, improve in-stocks, as Jeff mentioned. So that's certainly to drive the retail business. Then we're also focused on how do we improve the seller experience, so it makes it easier for sellers to sell.   

So, ultimately, where that will end up, in terms of balance, will be up to the customer to decide on where that ultimate mix will be. But our goal is certainly to improve the experience, keep on improving the experience for both sellers and customers. We think, with that, the customers can decide where that ends up.   

JEFF BEZOS: One category to highlight, perhaps, especially as we go into the holiday season here, is the toy category. This is going to be, by far, our best customer experience in the toy category in the Company's history. It's not only Amazon retail toys, but there are also now a very strong network of party toy sellers in the toy category. The combination of those is providing an outstanding customer experience. So that will be part of our record holiday, and we're really excited about it.   

SCOTT DEVITT: Are you able to give any information domestically related to Amazon Marketplace versus Merchants@ which maybe could give better color as to the international dynamics?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, I apologize; we really can't help you would that.   

OPERATOR: Justin Post,  Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: I have a couple of interrelated questions to gross margin. I've got your third-party units up north of 40%. It really looks like you're taking share there. Can you quantify at all the impact on gross margins? Do you expect that to really help maybe in next year?   

Then if you look at the US, if you back out the Harry Potter revenues, everybody is going to have their own assumptions. But it looks like gross margins were still down in the US, ex-that. Is that just because of the new categories, or was that more pricing-related? Could you really get into what drove that, and do you expect that part of your 4Q guidance?   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the North America piece, certainly Harry Potter is having an impact, negative impact on gross margins. Also mix of business is impacting gross margins as well.   

In terms of the other part of your question, the first part, can you just repeat that again?   

JUSTIN POST: We have your third-party units outstripping your regular unit growth; we have it over 40%. What kind of impact is that having on gross margins, and do you think that could be a positive driver as we look out to next year?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, in terms of impact, certainly our third-party business in general helps our gross margins, and certainly other factors to think about when you look at our gross margins are we continue to lower prices for customers, we continue to try to make sure we get great prices from suppliers and also a mix of business. Those are the key factors that are impacting gross margins.   

In terms of 2008, again, we will be giving our guidance for 2008 after the Q4 call.   

JUSTIN POST: As you look out to the holidays, any specific products that you're excited about or want to mention that we should be looking for on Amazon?   

TOM SZKUTAK: It's a good question. I mean, we have --   

JEFF BEZOS: There are probably a bunch, but the one that I would highlight is Amazon Prime. Especially during the holiday season, we have been very successful signing up Amazon Prime members, but there are still a lot of people out there that would benefit from being Amazon Prime members. The people who are members love it, and so that's certainly, for the holiday season, a very good product.   

OPERATOR: Edward Weller,  ThinkEquity Partners.

EDWARD WELLER, ANALYST, THINKEQUITY PARTNERS: My question has been answered, thank you.   

OPERATOR: Imran Khan,  JPMorgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Two questions. Number one, [I was better] understand that your gross profit margins in international is 20.5%; obviously, third-party is significantly lower in the international market. Just trying to get a better sense like how quickly you can narrow that gap between US and international gross profit margins.   

Second question is for Jeff. Jeff, you talked about putting customers first and to drive the growth and clear shareholders value. As your third-party business becomes a bigger and bigger part of your business and your third-party sellers number grows, how do you ensure the customer satisfaction?   

JEFF BEZOS: Well, I'll take that second one first. It's a very good question, and it's something we spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about and focusing on. We've done a lot, over time, to maintain that customer experience. It starts with making sure we have a good method of evaluating third-party sellers and making sure that they are sincere and want to do a great job for customers. We have a big team of people that do that.   

The other thing is we have started something called Fulfillment by Amazon, which is getting a lot of early traction, growing rapidly. It allows third-party sellers to effectively let us to the fulfillment for them. So they can, using Fulfillment by Amazon, send products directly to our fulfillment centers and then we do the shipping, packing and shipping directly to customers.   

That has a lot of systemwide efficiencies in it for the third-party seller and for us. Because, for one thing, if a customer orders two items, they may order an item from us and they might order an item from the third-party seller. If the third-party seller is using Fulfillment by Amazon, then we can marry those two items together in the single box, which saves a significant amount of money in transportation costs. We're able to pass some of that savings onto the third-party sellers who use Fulfillment by Amazon.   

At the same time, from a customer experience point of view, if we are the ones fulfilling that third-party unit, the customers get all of the benefits that they are accustomed to when they buy an Amazon retail unit. So, for example, they get giftwrap, they get Super Saver Shipping, Free Super Saver Shipping. If they are Amazon Prime members, they get two-day shipping for free on that third-party unit. So it basically levels the playing field for third-party sellers and allows them to give the consumer all of the same benefits that Amazon retail is providing.   

So, anyway, that's an example of the kind of program that we try to put in place. We're seeing very good reception from our seller community in taking us up on that offer.   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question, it's difficult to predict the answer to your question as it relates to gross margins. I can tell you how we think about it, though. We certainly -- some of the inputs are -- as we enter new categories, we're trying to make sure that we have a great customer experience. We start with adding selection. We continue to work on the inputs to customer experience, making it convenient for customers, making sure that the pricing is right.   

Over time, what happens is you'll get scale in that particular category. When you do that, good things happen. You have more third parties that are attracted to those detail pages to sell their products on. We also get better savings from vendors as we by more from vendors.   

So as you think about those countries that we are in today, as we improve the scale of those, by again adding new selection, adding new categories, those are the things that will help us with our core part of our retail business as well as third parties and getting better savings from vendors. So the combination of those things are certainly the things that will help us improve over time in international.   

IMRAN KHAN: If I may ask one more follow-questions, Jeff, in terms of Amazon Prime, you have had that for a while. Could you talk a little bit about the learnings you have from Amazon Prime? How does that help you to improve your fulfillment and inventory management efficiency? Do you think as we'll continue to have Amazon Prime and more customer takes, you can actually have better selections and better stock availability and can reduce your fulfillment?   

JEFF BEZOS: Well, one of the opportunities over time -- what Amazon Prime does, as it continues to grow, is it increases our express shipping volume. So we have more volume now being shipped two-day rather than standard. Because Amazon Prime members -- for $79 a year, Amazon Prime members get unlimited free two-day shipping with no hurdle. So you can have -- right now, our Free Super Saver Shipping offer is available to everyone, but it's a slower class of service, and it has a $25 minimum order threshold in order to qualify for Super Saver Shipping.   

So Amazon Prime members can buy -- they have no threshold, and they get two-day shipping for free. It's a very big change in the customer experience for an Amazon Prime member, and one that we know they love.   

Our opportunity over time on the cost structure site is a large one when we have sufficient scale to take advantage of it, because the opportunity is to modify the fulfillment center network so that it's optimized for faster delivery. You can imagine that a network optimized for two-day delivery would look a bit different from a network optimized for standard delivery.   

Anyway, so those kinds of opportunities are available to us in the future as we continue to scale.   

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth,  Lehman Brothers.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: I just have two questions. First, I wanted to follow up on Prime and just ask if you can tell us what the early returns of Prime have been in Japan.   

Second, can you give us some color on the large amount of hiring that you did during 3Q? I think you added 1,400 people to your headcount. Was that mostly based in fulfillment centers, or was there another part of the business?   

JEFF BEZOS: The answer to your second part of your question is yes, the majority of that was fulfillment center-related as we get ready for the holiday season. So those are largely variable personnel as we grow our business in Q4.   

In terms of the Prime question as it relates to Japan -- I believe was your question -- it's very, very early. But from what we see so far, we're very pleased. Customers love the offering that we have. They are very excited about it. So it's still very, very early, but we're getting very good feedback from customers.   

OPERATOR: Jeffrey Lindsay, Sanford Bernstein.   

JEFFREY LINDSAY, ANALYST, SANFORD BERNSTEIN: We understand from the press that there's some dispute about the patent exclusivity of 1-Click. Could you give us some guidance on how significant the loss of 1-Click patent exclusivity could be for Amazon?   

Second, could you also give us some guidance on what the potential impact could be from loss of the Borders book business in 2008?   

Finally, could you just give us an indication of how well you're doing in fresh groceries?   

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of the one-click, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about such matters outside of our public filings. But you should refer to our public filings.   

Then in terms of the other parts of your question, the grocery piece -- we have a category, dry goods/grocery that we're very pleased with the performance to date. It's a great way for customers to buy a number of different dry goods, assortment of dry goods items, generally in bulk. So we are very excited about what we see there so far. But again, it's still very early.   

JEFFREY LINDSAY: And we were wondering about the Borders book business? Could you comment on that?   

JEFF BEZOS: Yes, I don't really have any comments on any specific contracts.   

OPERATOR: Shawn Milne, Oppenheimer.   

SHAWN MILNE, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER: Tom, I just have a couple of housekeeping questions. In terms of your revenue growth guidance in the fourth quarter, are you assuming any material impact, follow-on impact from Harry Potter?   

I just wanted to follow up on the fulfillment question. It did dip below, as a percent of sales, a little bit what we were looking for. Does that actually -- are you seeing any impact already, from what Jeff was talking about, in terms of scale with the fulfillment network? Or is it just the Harry Potter impact on fulfillment costs in the third quarter?   

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of the impact of Q4 as it relates to Harry Potter VII, there certainly will be sales that will happen related to Harry Potter VII, but it won't be as sizable as what you're seeing in Q3, or at least we're not anticipating that. As you look at the -- in quarters where we've had sales such as that, that has been the biggest impact.   

In terms of fulfillment, what you're seeing is just leveraging our overall fulfillment center infrastructure. I don't have any other comments beyond that.   

OPERATOR: Colin Sebastian, Lazard Capital Markets.   

COLIN SEBASTIAN, ANALYST, LAZARD CAPITAL MARKETS: One follow-up on Prime. Obviously, you're seeing a positive impact there on unit sales and subscriptions doubled year over year. I'm wondering if you have begun marketing that more aggressively off of the websites and, if so, what traction you might be seeing there?   

I have one follow-up question.   

JEFF BEZOS: Not in any significant way. Most of our marketing is to our existing customers on the website. So I think that's the answer to your question.   

COLIN SEBASTIAN: And the follow-up, on FPS, the payment service, I'm curious what kind of traction you are maybe seeing for that service early on. What kinds of retailers are you seeing adopt the service?   

JEFF BEZOS: You're talking about FPS, which is our -- for anybody else on the call who may not know that FPS stands for Flexible Payment Service. It is one of our infrastructure Web Services, so along with the Elastic Compute Cloud and the Simple Storage Service, the Simple [Q] Service. These services are all developer-facing services, so they are a set of APIs that software developers can use to build web-scale applications.   

The Flexible Payment Service -- obviously, if you're building web-scale applications, in many cases you have to be able to charge people for things. The Flexible Payment Service is the first payment service specifically designed from the ground up for developers, and it has a lot of features that make it very flexible and easy to use for developers to incorporate payments into their own applications.   

So that set of services that we're offering to developers is growing very, very rapidly and has gotten an unusual amount of traction, and we are very, very gratified to see this early uptake in the development community. It's happening at the very small scale with small software developers, sort of one-person and two-person shops. It's also happening at the middle scale with venture capital-funded startups. Then at the large scale, with enterprise customers all the way from the small up to the big.   

So it's a very exciting and new product offering. These infrastructure services are things that we needed to build for ourselves in order to run the web-scale application called Amazon. While we were in the process of building these things, we decided to build them in an externalizable way, so that we could charge for them and turn them into a new profit center. We're very excited about this.   

KIM NELSON: Thanks, Colin, and thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in  Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.   

OPERATOR: That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the  Amazon.com second-quarter 2007 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.   

For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead.   

   TD
KIM NELSON, DIRECTOR OF IR,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q2 2007 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.   

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 24, 2007 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2006 annual report on Form 10-K.   

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2006.   

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.   

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP, CFO,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Kim. I'll begin with comments on our financial results.   

Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 87% to $700 million, while the combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding decreased 2% to $435 million. Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $2.89 billion, or 33% excluding the $46 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $1.83 billion, up 27% or 25% excluding foreign exchange rates.   

EGM revenue increased to $970 million, up 55% or 53% excluding FX. EGM continued to increase its share of our worldwide sales mix, representing 34% of sales in Q2 of 2007, up from 29% for the same period last year.   

Our worldwide unit growth was 25%, and active customer accounts exceeded 69 million, up 16% year over year. Worldwide gross profit was $701 million, up 38%. Gross margin increased 49 basis points to 24.3%, primarily due to the wind-down and termination last year of our contract with TRU, which negatively impacted worldwide gross margins in Q2 2006 by approximately 90 basis points and North America gross margin by approximately 170 basis points. This was offset partially by product mix. Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.1 million in third-party units, representing Marketplace and Merchants@ units sold on Amazon sites were 30% of total units versus 29% in the prior year.   

Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $536 million or 18.6% of sales, an improvement of 148 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $248 million or 8.6% of net sales, up 8 basis points year over year. In the quarter, we announced plans for a new fulfillment center in Phoenix, and we opened up a fulfillment center in Guangzhou, China. Technology and content was $176 million or 6.1% of net sales, an improvement of 99 basis points year over year as we continue to grow into our new level of spending. In 2007, technology and content will increase in absolute dollars, but we expect the growth rate of our spending in T&C to be significantly less than it was in 2006.   

Now I'll talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we cannot [allocate the segments or] stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 38% to $1.6 billion. This is the highest growth rate in more than six years. Media revenue grew 26% to $923 million. EGM revenue grew 66% to $606 million, representing 38% of North America revenues, up from 32%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, and revenue from soft goods, which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes and sporting goods, doubled year over year. North America gross profit grew 40% to $434 million, and gross margin increased 34 basis points. North America segment operating income increased 233% to $82 million, a 5.1% operating margin.   

In the International segment, revenue was $1.28 billion, up 31% year over year or 26% adjusted for the $45 million favorable foreign exchange impact. Media revenue grew 27% to $910 million or 23% excluding FX. In EGM, revenue grew 40% to $364 million or 34% excluding FX. International gross profit grew 34% to $267 million or grew 29% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 48 basis points to 20.8%, which reflects increased third-party mix offset partially by lower prices, product mix and free shipping offers. International segment operating income increased 50% to $83 million, a 6.4% operating margin. Excluding the $3 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International operating income increased 42%.   

Consolidated segment operating income grew 106% to $165 million or 5.7% of net sales, up 198 basis points year over year.   

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 149% to $116 million or 4% of net sales.   

Our provision for income taxes was $33 million in Q2 or a 30% rate for the quarter, which includes a $4 million year-to-date adjustment to reflect our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate of 26%, which incorporates our strong North America growth. As a reminder, there's potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate, due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of tax flow income by jurisdiction.   

In 2007, we anticipate cash paid for income taxes will be approximately $25 million, compared to $15 million in 2006, as we continue to benefit from NOLs in the United States. NOL utilization is impacted by many factors, including our access stock-based compensation deductions.   

GAAP net income was $78 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with $22 million and $0.05 per diluted share.   

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities were $1.66 billion, an increase of $245 million year over year. Inventory increased 41% to $735 million, and inventory turns decreased from 14.3 a year ago to 12.9 as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories.   

Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $38 million from a year ago to $443 million. Our return on invested capital was 39%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities.   

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.   

As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intercompany balances in foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material impact on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.   

For Q3, we expect net sales of between $3 billion and $3.175 billion or growth of between 30% and 38%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.   

GAAP operating income to be between $75 million and $110 million or grow between 88% and 175%. This includes approximately $50 million for stock-base compensation and amortization of intangible assets.   

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $125 million and $160 million, or grow between 73% and 122%.   

For the calendar year 2007, we expect net sales of between $13.8 billion and $14.3 billion or growth of between 29% and 34%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.   

GAAP operating income to be between $540 million and $640 million or growth of between 39% and 65%. This includes approximately $185 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.   

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $725 million and $825 million or grow between 45% and 65%.   

We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with some variability from changes in working capital. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250 million.   

We will continue to strive for year-over-your annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share, while investing in our long-term opportunities. We're confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand.   

With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.   

KIM NELSON: Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?   

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Mary Meeker,  Morgan Stanley.

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: (technical difficulty) and Mary here, and we just have really one question. It seems like you saw a pretty strong improvement in gross margin. I know that there was a one-time impact there, but it also seems that there might be third-party sales at work there, which continue to be strong, or so it seems.   

I guess our question is twofold. One is, why do you think you're seeing such strong traction in third-party sales right now? How important is this to the improvement of Amazon's gross margins going forward? In other words, how sustainable do you think this is?   

TOM SZKUTAK: As it relates to third parties, as we have been mentioning really over the past few years, we have been investing in improving what we call seller platforms, and that's surrounding everything that makes it easier for sellers to sell, which includes third parties as well as ourselves. So I think what you are seeing is certainly an improvement in third-party sales, third-party units with 30% for the quarter as a percentage of total units, which is up from 29%. Certainly, some of that is the launch of Merchants@ International, which we have mentioned on previous calls.   

So certainly, that's what you're seeing there. In terms of the importance of it overall, I'll talk about it in terms of our free cash flow rather than our gross margins. We think that this model of having us as a seller as well as third-party is very important for customers, and also works for us financially as well. So what the customer sees is they get additional selection that they might not ordinarily get from us by having third parties. They also get the benefit of seeing where there's overlap, seeing competing sellers on our detail pages, which they can select from. So we think the combination of these factors is great for customers and great for shareholders, and so we think it should be a meaningful part of our business as we move forward.   

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto,  Goldman Sachs.

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: [You mentioned] the third-party business being launched internationally. But it looks like the bulk of your acceleration in revenue is from your North American business growing 38% year over year, [which is starting] in the first quarter, while International decelerated.   

So I want to focus in on that. When we look at the domestic business's acceleration, and we drill down, it looks like it accelerated in both Media and EGM, EGM being the biggest factor, up 66% versus 51% in the first quarter. My question is very specifically, what drove the most incremental dollars in North American EGM to drive that 66% year-over-year growth, which category?   

TOM SZKUTAK: We're not providing details on the specific categories that make up EGM, but in terms of what's driving it is customers are responding to what they believe is an excellent value proposition, which includes low prices, fast delivery and increased selection.   

As part of that fast delivery, Prime is certainly a factor. Prime is a more meaningful part of our overall units during Q2 than it has been previously. So we have more subscribers, as well as they are buying more. So that's certainly a key driver.   

One other thing to keep in mind, in addition to those key factors, is as you look at year-over-year, specifically for North America, keep in mind that last year Q2 we had the impact of the wind-down and determination of TRU, which infected our revenue by approximately $20 million, which we disclosed last year during Q2. So keep that in mind as you look at our overall growth results in EGM as well.   

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.   

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Good quarter, guys. A couple of questions. I guess, as you look at your growth in newer categories, non-media related, can you talk about what is the growth a result of? Is it actually more the consumer experience and what Amazon has continued to present to the consumer, or do you think it is more the seller economics from a third-party standpoint?   

Second, as you look at the penetration of third party, it looks like about 50% to 55% of US units and maybe around 5% to 10% in the UK, given the strength domestically. Can you talk about how do you grow or expand the third-party business internationally? What are the critical success factors for you to get to a 50/55 split internationally as you see in the US?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, in terms of the overall numbers, we have not actually provided any numbers by segment. So the numbers that you are quoting -- we haven't provided what the third-party units are by segment. Overall, it's 30% as a percentage of total. What we have said, though, is that our North America is higher than International, so there's clearly an opportunity there.   

But in terms of how we drive it, it's consistent with what we've said in the past. We are continuously focused on how to make the experience better for customers as well as sellers.   

So you're talking about some of the new categories as part of your question. What we're finding is, when you launch a new category, you need traffic to those detail pages. As you get more meaningful traffic to those detail pages, it becomes more attractive for third-party sellers to participate.   

So that's the best way for us to help our third-party business, is the same as it is to help our retail business, which is to make that customer experience great. When we do that, it attracts customers and traffic to our detail pages, which is good for sellers, which ultimately is good for customers, having these offers, as well as investors. So that's how they intertwine.   

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney,  Citigroup.

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: A question for Jeff. Jeff, could you provide an update on some (technical difficulty) music and/or video offerings, how Amazon (technical difficulty)?   

JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT, CEO, CHAIRMAN,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: Speakerphone, perhaps? If you could pick up.   

TOM SZKUTAK: We just can't hear your question.   

JEFF BEZOS: Yes, sorry, if you could repeat the question?   

MARK MAHANEY: Sorry, I apologize. An update on some of the digital media offerings (technical difficulty) video and how -- what kind of traction you are seeing (technical difficulty).   

JEFF BEZOS: On some of the digital media offerings, could you discuss the traction that you are seeing? Is that the question? Sorry, you are breaking up a little bit.   

MARK MAHANEY: Yes. We are having a power outage.   

JEFF BEZOS: It's too early for us to discuss any of the traction we're seeing. As you know, we have Amazon Unbox, which has downloadable videos, and have made arrangements with TiVo so that we can offer customers those videos directly to their TiVo Series 2 and Series 3 Internet-connected boxes. Then we have announced but not yet launched an MP3 DRM-free music offering that we're very excited about, but you'll have to wait and stay tuned for that.   

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Banc of America.   

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA: Can you provide some additional color on the impact of Harry Potter attachments in the quarter? Can you also give us any sense for advertising on the site, the potential impact there? Because we have been seen more and more advertisements throughout.   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the impact of Harry Potter 7 -- you're relating to Q2? Is that your question?   

BRIAN PITZ: Yes.   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Harry Potter 7, all of the shipments of the book are happening during Q3. But it's the associated attachments -- our normal practice is to ship those products as they become available. So the impact on Q2 was less than 100 basis points globally. There's certainly also some -- there's traffic in addition to that, which is difficult to quantify what the incremental impact of that is. But in terms of the attachments themselves, it's less than 100 basis points.   

BRIAN PITZ: Great. And just any color on advertising, any impact there? Or not really material yet?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Could you be more specific with your question?   

BRIAN PITZ: Sure. Is advertising becoming a more material line item, would you say, going forward? Because we have been seeing a lot more advertisers throughout the site.   

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. We haven't broken it out. Certainly, we're testing a number of things and seeing how they work. But that's the way we are thinking about it.   

OPERATOR: Robert Peck,  Bear Stearns.

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Tom, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about free cash flow here. One of the great things about Amazon historically is you have managed your share count very well. It looks like this quarter you issued about 5.8 million shares, compared to last year for the full year you did around 9 million to 10 million, of which you bought back about 6 million or so. How do we think about the use of the free cash flow in 2007 and 2008, as we think about the increase of your shares, having almost doubled over the last three or four months? To buyback those 10 million shares would cost you north of $750 million. So how should we think about the allocation of the free cash flow going forward?   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of just one correction -- maybe I might have misheard what you said. In terms of the share repurchase, you mentioned 6 million or 7 million. We actually purchased 14.5 million shares, which is $500 million over the past year. Maybe I just misheard the way you said it.   

ROBERT PECK: I meant calendar year.   

TOM SZKUTAK: Calendar year, okay. In terms of looking forward, what we have said, certainly, is we have Board authorization to purchase up to $500 million worth of shares over the next two years. We also have an authorization to retire up to $500 million of debt.   

But what you should expect to see is, similar to what we have done in the past, we're going to think about it very thoughtfully in making sure that we do what is right for shareholders. We have been very mindful of -- certainly, we have retired debt that we think is appropriate. We talked about the 14.5 million shares that we repurchased over the past three or four years. We've also retired some convertible debt that avoided potential dilution of just under 10 million shares.   

So those are some of the examples of things that we've done in the past. But going forward, certainly, we will certainly be very mindful and do the right thing from a treasury or corporate finance perspective as we think about those decisions.   

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth,  Lehman Brothers.

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Typically, in the past, when EGM has spiked as a percentage of your sales, it's negatively impacted gross margins a little bit. But here, EGM came in at 34% and you still posted some good gross margin upside. So can you talk more specifically about the drivers within gross margins and also whether the mix within EGM during the quarter was any different than it has been in the past?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the gross margins, keep in mind gross margins for the quarter were up 50 basis points year over year. Keep in mind what I mentioned earlier related to the wind-down and termination of TRU, the impact that had on both revenue as well as gross profit and operating profit being a similar amount in terms of that termination.   

Now, that being said, those categories -- meaning toys, baby and videogames -- you should assume that as we launch those, those are like other categories that we launch, that when we launch new categories we are pricing our products very competitively and that they are lower gross margins to start with. So it's not a full impact of that 20 that you are seeing year over year.   

So those are some of the dynamics related to that. But in terms of other, we continue to have great low prices for customers. Offsetting that, we continue to be diligent on the COGS side, trying to get additional COGS out. Also what you're seeing, to make up the balance, is specifically around third party, third party being 30% of total units, up from 29%. That's certainly overlapping where some of the toys was certainly third-party business last year, Q3. So that's taking into account that. So that would have been higher if that wasn't in there, if that makes sense. So those are some of the key drivers.   

OPERATOR: Justin Post,  Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: A couple things on the operating expense line. It looks like tech expense reaccelerated a bit. It was up $15 million sequentially. Any new initiatives on the tech side that you're excited about?   

Then on the marketing side, it looks like it was up 22% year over year, below revenue growth. Are you seeing some [deflation] in marketing costs, or could that have been just some Harry Potter traffic benefits that you got in the quarter?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, in terms of -- I'll take the marketing one first. Marketing was 2.2% of revenue. If you look back, really, over the past two to three years, the range has been fairly tight; it has been anywhere from 2.2% to 2.7%. Certainly, this past quarter was at the lower end of that range. But there's nothing really unusual about that. I wouldn't expect it to, over time, to stay at the lower end of that range as you're thinking about it.   

In terms of technology and content, we did -- as we have said, we're going to continue to grow technology and content dollars. They were up about 16% year over year. Certainly, you're seeing some very positive leverage in the quarter due to that, because last year, Q2 was up 63%. So that's the delta that you are seeing, but we continue to invest in digital and Web Services, improving seller platforms, this category expansion that's included in those numbers as well, and other customer experience things that we are working on.   

OPERATOR: Aaron Kessler, Piper Jaffray.   

AARON KESSLER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: A couple of quick questions. First, on the Web Services, (inaudible) that you're getting increasing traction there, maybe where you're seeing the best traction, and what do you see as the biggest opportunity [of loans], starting with Amazon Web Services?   

On the gross margin, Domestics right now is about 6% ahead of International. Any reason we should think that International can't get similar to Domestic longer-term, assuming that you can get to a similar level of third-party sales?   

JEFF BEZOS: I'll take the Web Services one, and Tom can take the gross margins one. We are seeing very good early traction in our Web Services initiatives. It's one of the areas that we have been investing in over the last couple of years. It's very encouraging to see that traction. We've got a lot of great customers, and the team that's doing that is creating a lot of value for those customers. They are making it much easier for those customers to do business.   

This customer set is developers. A lot of them are start-up companies. If you are a start-up company building a web scale application, there's a lot of work that has to go into that.   

A lot of that work is not differentiating. So it's things like picking the right operating systems, getting your data centers set up and entering into contracts, et cetera, et cetera. There are a lot of decisions to be made, and it's kind of a price of admission. It has to be done well, but it doesn't actually move the ball forward, in terms of creating your differentiated product or service.   

So what Amazon Web Services does is make it easy for people, for developers, start-up companies and bigger companies -- we're seeing kind of a wide range of adoption from individuals, start-up companies of a single person to venture capital-funded start-up companies, all the way to very large corporations using these services.   

So we're very optimistic about the long-term potential. It's still very early, but we're working very hard on this, and we think it's, in the long-term, a very important business. We are very, very glad and we feel very lucky to have this new set of customers to work with, these developers.   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the other part of your question, related to gross margins, keep in mind that each of the countries that we operate in have their own local competitors. In any given quarter or time period, you could have competitive dynamics which would make our gross margins on any particular category either higher or lower. But, that being said, from a structural -- if you step back for a moment, from a structural standpoint, we don't think that there's a lot of differences of why or reasons why that they couldn't be similar over time.   

So the biggest thing that we need to do is we have a lot more selection today, as we have more categories in our US website. We have been expanding our International categories, as you have noticed over the past several years. But inclusive of the last couple quarters, you should expect to see an additional selection being added and new categories over the next 12 months in International.   

We talked about the third-party piece being more meaningful in North America versus International and some of the dynamics around that. So again, as we improve the customer experience, we think that that will be helpful to our International websites, to bring those closer. As we get more meaningful in terms of size, in terms of negotiating better deals with suppliers, in terms of just higher rebates, just because of the sheer volume that we purchase, we think will get better.   

So all those things are hopeful as we continue to grow, and has the ability to make those closer and closer over time.   

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt,  Stifel Nicolaus.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: The question relates to the US business. There doesn't seem to have been a significant change in new users or new customers to the site, but the revenue growth rate acceleration is certainly meaningful.   

So I'm trying to see if you can give some detail, in terms of frequency changes in terms of purchasing patterns of the customer set, within Prime versus your other customers. I ask because the Media category, which is one of the more mature categories of the business, has accelerated now by 1100 basis points, if you go back to September of 2006. It seems as if that category benefits most from frequency increases of the Prime customer.   

TOM SZKUTAK: We haven't disclosed any of the frequency patterns between Prime and non-Prime customers. But certainly, to get back to the drivers of what's helping our North America growth, the value proposition, low prices and fast delivery -- which includes, certainly, Prime -- is a big deal for us. It's certainly having an impact on our overall growth rate and becoming more meaningful as part of our overall units, and it's impacting both Media categories as well as EGM.   

So, in terms of frequency, we're certainly seeing -- we like what we see, particularly -- across the board, but particularly we like what we are seeing in Prime as it relates to frequency. Because that's really what the program is designed to do, and that's what we are seeing.   

OPERATOR: Imran Khan,  JPMorgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Obviously, your US growth rate is pretty strong. I was wondering, how should we think about the International business? What are you doing to reaccelerate that business from this level? Not that the growth rate is bad, but reaccelerate to get to the US level.   

Secondly, I think, Tom, you touched a little bit about the improving gross profit margin in the International market, that there's a 700 basis points difference between US versus International. Could you comment on that, how quickly we can see that gap to narrow?   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of what are we doing with International, it was some of the things that I mentioned earlier, where we have been launching new categories, increasing selection and focused on improving the overall customer experience. Some of the things that we have done for  Amazon.com, our US website, we're also doing in International. One example of that is we launched Prime in Japan recently, so that's certainly something that we've found, certainly, meaningful for our US website and are hopeful for Japan as well.   

So that's just another example. But there are many things that we're working on to try to improve the overall customer experience, which includes increased selection.   

Another one is certainly when we launched Merchants@ International. We showed the revenue growth. We had, actually, very solid unit growth in International, and one of the reasons why was because of launching Merchants@ International. So we have given customers more additional selection that they didn't have before, on top of our growing retail selection has been helpful. So those are the things that we're working on to try to maximize our growth in International.   

OPERATOR: Shawn Milne, Oppenheimer.   

SHAWN MILNE, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER: Thank you and a good quarter. A lot has been talked about or asked about your third-party business. If we actually strip out the Toys "R" Us units or what we estimate the Toys "R" Us units last year, we were estimating this is the third quarter in a row of 50% third-party unit growth. You talked about some of the structural changes you made to Seller Central. Do you think there has also been an uptick here on how you structured the actual buying experience or enabling sellers to get access to the buy box on Amazon, and how that has impacted the third-party business? We've heard pretty big upticks in unit volume from sellers that have been able to get inside that box. If you can talk about that?   

Secondly, your incremental margin in the quarter was 11%. That's the highest I've seen in six or seven years. Tom, can you discuss a little bit on how -- are we very quickly going to reach double-digit operating margins, or are there other big investment? If you can talk about some of the other areas you are going to invest in, in the next 12, 18 months?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, in terms of seller experience, there's a number of things that we're working on seller experience. I'm not sure, really, what you're referring to as it relates to the buy box in terms of changes. But there's a number of things we're working on to improve the seller experience. You mentioned some of them in Seller Central.   

Another one is -- which improves the customer experience and, we think, the seller experience is Fulfilled by Amazon or FBA. That's something that's very, very early for us. But again, it allows customers to buy from third-party merchants with us as the fulfiller. So that's something that we think is worth noting, even though it's still very early. So it's a way to improve the seller experience so the seller can focus on all of the other aspect associated with running their business, but not have to worry about the fulfillment side. So we think that that's clearly important.   

Again, a number of other seller experience initiatives as well. What was the other -- oh, in terms of the operating margins, as we've said in the past, nothing has changed. Our focus is to grow, to provide a great customer experience, which we think will translate into maximizing free cash flow per share, and we are very focused on that over time.   

In terms of the level of operating margins, we've said that we think that double-digit operating margins are possible. That's not a projection, but they are possible. But what we're going to do is focus on maximizing free cash flow per share. If it works out to be that that's double-digit operating margins or some high single digits, that's fine. But again, the way to do that is to drive operating profit dollars, continue to work on leveraging our operating cycle as well as our fixed investment. We think those are the things that will help us get there.   

JEFF BEZOS: I would just ad, on Fulfillment by Amazon, that the early sellers who are using that program -- we're getting very positive feedback from them. It does accelerate their sales, because the consumers on Amazon, the buying customers, as soon as a seller starts using Fulfillment by Amazon, the buyers get to enjoy Free Super Saver Shipping; they get to enjoy the privileges of Amazon Prime membership on those items.   

So when a seller switches to Fulfillment by Amazon, a lot of the things that customers associate with items sold directly by Amazon all of a sudden apply, from a customer experience point of view, to those seller-sold items as well. That's a big deal for Amazon Prime members to be able to buy those items. So, as sellers join Fulfillment by Amazon, they can see an acceleration in sales, because of the improved customer experience of having Amazon do the fulfillment -- offer free shipping, offer Fulfillment by Amazon, gift wrapping, next-day air shipment, et cetera, et cetera -- all the things that we have kind of worked hard over the last dozen years to get good at, those things automatically become something that's easy for sellers to offer their customers as well.   

OPERATOR: Jeffrey Lindsay, Sanford Bernstein.   

JEFFREY LINDSAY, ANALYST, SANFORD BERNSTEIN: I'd just like to ask -- International growth was good, but not as good as the US. I'd like to ask, why was this? Is it a product mix issue? Could we assume that International will eventually catch up with the US?   

TOM SZKUTAK: It's some of the things I mentioned earlier in the call. Clearly, we're seeing what I would consider very solid growth in International today, and North America certainly has accelerated. Again, it's really driven by the value proposition, the pricing as well as fast delivery, fast delivery Prime being the big piece of that. Certainly, one way to help do that is to -- which is what we're doing -- is in this case, launching Prime in Japan as one example of a way to make that happen.   

Also, we have a bigger selection in our North America business or our US website, and we're expanding selection rapidly in our International websites as well. So that's another way of trying to get an experience that's better and better for customers.   

OPERATOR: Heath Terry,  Credit Suisse.

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: In the past, you've talked about using the margin leverage or the incremental leverage that you had in the business as fuel to lower prices and drive more free cash flow growth through the model. Should we assume that the margin growth that we're seeing here suggests that you guys feel like you have hit the sweet spot as far as lower prices are concerned, and that lower prices from here won't necessarily drive higher free cash flow and that we really should start to expect more margin exchange?   

TOM SZKUTAK: No, you shouldn't assume that. You should assume that we're going to continue to make sure it's a very dynamic environment. There are many, many competitors out there in each of the categories that we sell in, on all of our websites around the world. Again, so we're going to continue to make sure that we have great prices for customers, and that's critical to the customer experience that we provide. It's one of the pillars that we have talked frequently about, so ultimately we're trying to make sure that we offer that great value proposition, which includes pricing, and it's the foundation of what we do. Nothing has changed there.   

KIM NELSON: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in  Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com first-quarter 2007 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.   

(technical difficulty) remarks I will (technical difficulty) the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead.   

   TD
KIM NELSON, DIRECTOR OF IR,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2007 financial results conference (technical difficulty). Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.   

The following discussions and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 24, 2007 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2006 annual report on Form 10-K.   

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.   

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2006.   

Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.   

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP, CFO,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Kim. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 4% to $521 million (technical difficulty) of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding decreased 2% to $430 million. Worldwide revenue grew 32% to $3.02 billion or 29% excluding the $84 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $1.99 billion, up 26% or 23% excluding FX. This is the highest growth rate for Worldwide Media in three years.   

EGM revenue increased to $947 million, up 48% or 44% excluding FX. EGM continued to increase it share of our Worldwide (technical difficulty) representing 31% of sales in Q1 2007, up from 28% for the same period last year.   

Our worldwide unit growth was 23%, and active customer accounts exceeded $66 million, up 15% year over year. Worldwide gross profit was $719 million, up 31%. Gross margin decreased 17 basis points to 23.8%. Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.1 million, and third-party units representing Marketplace and Merchants@ units sold on Amazon sites were 30% of total units versus 29% in the prior year.   

Now, I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $540 million or 17.9% of sales, an improvement of 86 basis (technical difficulty) year over year.   

Fulfillment was $253 million or 8.4% of net sales, up 6 basis points year over year. We continue to increase capacity through efficiencies, as well as adding leased warehouse space to our network. In the quarter, we announced plans for additional warehouses, one in the UK and one in France, supporting our International operations.   

Technology and content was $167 million or 5.5% of net sales, an improvement of 55 basis points year over year, as we've continued to grow into our new level of spending. In 2007, technology and content will increase in absolute dollars, but we expect the growth rate of our spending in T&C to be significantly less than it was in 2006.   

Now, I'll talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 30% to $1.62 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $990 million. EGM revenue grew 51% to $564 million, representing 35% of North America revenues, up from 30%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics and revenue from soft goods -- which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes and sporting goods -- more than doubled year over year.   

Additionally, we are pleased with the early customer response to our grocery subscription service, which offers automated replenishment plus a 15% additional discount. Some of the most popular items for subscription include diapers, nutrition bars and coffee.   

North America gross profit grew 29% to $439 million, and gross margin decreased 27 basis points to 27.1% from product mix and lowering prices. North America segment operating income increased 39% to $86 million, a 5.3% operating margin, up 34 basis points year over year.   

In the International segment, revenue grew 35% to $1.39 billion. Revenue growth was 27%, adjusting for the $84 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 31% to $1 billion or 24% excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 44% to $383 million or 34% excluding FX.   

International gross profit grew 36% to $280 million or grew 27% excluding FX, while gross margin increased 9 basis points to 20.1%, which reflects increasing third-party mix offset partially by lowering prices, product mix and free shipping offers. International segment operating income increased 61% to $93 million or 6.7% operating margin, up 109 basis points year over year. Excluding the $7 million favorable impact from FX, international operating income increased 47%.   

CSOI grew 50% to $179 million or 6% of net sales, up 69 basis points year over year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 38% to $145 million or 4.8% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $33 million in Q1, reflecting an effective tax rate of 23%.   

We expect our effective tax rate in 2007 to be approximately 23%. However, there's potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate, due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of tax flow income by jurisdiction. In 2007, we anticipate cash paid for income taxes will be approximately $25 million, compared to $15 million in 2006, as we continue to benefit from NOLs in the US.   

GAAP net income was $111 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared with $51 million and $0.12 per diluted share.   

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities were $1.42 billion, an increase of $86 million year over year. During the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock for $248 million, and today we announced authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock over the next 24 months.   

Inventory increased 40% to $754 million, and inventory turns decreased from 14.4 a year ago to 12.9 as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories.   

Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $81 million from a year ago to $442 million. Our return on invested capital was 30%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities.   

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there's a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.   

As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our Euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intercompany balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on our guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently.   

For Q2, we expect net sales of between $2.7 billion and $2.85 billion or growth of between 26% and 33%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $65 million and $105 million or grow between 39% and 125%. This includes approximately $45 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.   

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $110 million and $150 million, or grow between 38% and 88%. For calendar year 2007, we expect net sales of between $13.4 billion and $14 billion or growth of between 25% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange.   

GAAP operating income to be between $463 million and $593 million or growth of between 19% and 52%. This includes approximately $170 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $630 million and $760 million or growth between 26% and 52%.   

We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with some variability from changes in working capital. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250 million.   

We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share, while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand.   

Thanks. And with that, Kim, let's move to questions.   

KIM NELSON: Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on to to the portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?   

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Robert Peck, Bear Stearns.   

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Tom, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. One is, could you give us a little bit of color around the spending of S3/EC2, where you see that spending going over the next couple of quarters? What capacity are you using to handle the demand there? How does that capacity get adjusted for the 4Q?   

The second question is more on gross margins. When you see gross margins trending over the next couple of quarters, how do you see the impact of any further increased shipping supplements or even negative shipping stuff you have been testing out over at Endless.com?   

TOM SZKUTAK: Could you repeat the gross margin question again? I didn't hear the last part of it.   

ROBERT PECK: The gross margin question is just more of how should we think about gross margins going forward to reflect any further increased shipping rebates, shipping supplements and even implications of things like Endless.com, what you're doing over there?   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of gross margins, certainly the Endless rebate that you have mentioned was also the negative $5 shipping, if you will, is included in the results that you saw in Q1. So that's reflected in Q1, and it's reflected, whatever we might do going forward in each of our categories, certainly reflected in the guidance that we have given. But what you're seeing in Q1 is certainly a contraction in our gross margins, meaning it was down 17 basis points year over year versus what we saw more recently, where it was down 110 basis points for the year, total year 2006 versus total year 2005, as well as a similar number for Q4.   

What you're seeing really is strength in our third-party business, which you saw reflected particularly in our International gross margins, as well as improvements in COGS. As we move forward, we are certainly still working very hard to get furthers COGS improvements, and the growth that we have seen in a lot of the categories and the scale that we are getting is helping us do that.   

JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT, CEO, CHAIRMAN,  AMAZON.COM, INC.: I'll take the EC2 and S3 question and just say we don't break it out. We are seeing very strong demand for those services, and expect to continue to roll out new capacity for them.   

ROBERT PECK: Meaning that in the fourth quarter, you therefore build up more capacity to handle what could be increased demand with that segment?   

JEFF BEZOS: We have been adding new capacity for those services, and I continue to expect that to continue indefinitely.   

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto,  Goldman Sachs.

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Tom, you alluded to the margins internationally, gross margins, benefiting from the increased mix of third party. Those margins on a historic basis relative to the US have been quite a bit below. Do you think, as that mix continues to improve, you could get your gross margin internationally to where they are domestically? If not, why?   

Second question -- can you qualify how much you think you benefit from the preorders of Harry Potter during this quarter, in terms of incremental traffic or attachment rates from preorders?   

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of International, that's certainly one way which our International and North America gross margins will become closer over time. So certainly, it's an opportunity. Even though we saw nice growth in International third party, it's still, as a percentage of total units, not as high a percentage as our North America. So it's really an opportunity for us going forward.   

So other areas as well, as you would imagine, our International segment is a makeup of several different countries. From a buying perspective, as we get the scale in each of those categories and each of those countries, it will help us buy better, which will also help us improve margins over time. So those are really the key drivers.   

In terms of preorders, the effect on Q1 has been small. We're very pleased with the preorders that we have today for Harry Potter 7, but in terms of the impact on our overall growth rate in Q1, we think it's a pretty small number.   

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citi Investment Research.   

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITI INVESTMENT RESEARCH: I want to just follow up on the third-party sales growth internationally. Can you give us any more clarity on that? Were there particular categories or stores in which you saw that third-party growth or particular countries?   

Then just a real quick question on the tax rate. It seems like it jumps around a lot. Is it reasonable to assume that 23% this year is what it will be like next year? Why the big change or the big bring-down in the tax rate guidance?   

TOM SZKUTAK: I'll take the tax rate question first. There is a lot of variability in the tax rate. The 23% is our best estimate for 2007. It's also our actual effective tax rate for Q1. We're not giving guidance on our effective tax rate going forward beyond 2007, again because of the variability surrounding it. I would like to point out, though, as well, that our cash taxes paid last year were $15 million. We're estimating this year sheer to be approximately $25 million. So that's related to taxes.   

Your other question was related to third party. I think the only other color maybe -- you were looking for some additional color -- is just to keep in mind that we launched Merchants@ International in the UK and Germany in the second half of last year. We've more recently launched it in Japan, and so that's a certainly a driver or one of the drivers.   

But one of the other things that we've talked about frequently related to our International business and launching new categories in general -- the more traffic we get to those individual categories, good things happen. What I mean by good things happen -- we're able to have -- since we have more traffic, we are able to get more third parties selling on our detail pages, as well as get better COGS improvements over time. So that's some of what you're seeing reflected in our Q1 results.   

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt,  Stifel Nicolaus.

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: First, on the breakdown of revenue, Amazon is the only large Internet company where the domestic sales are (technical difficulty) than International sales. So I'm wondering if you could just talk to in the markets that you're in internationally, the capacity for growth rates to actually improve with time. I think you noted the launch of [Marketplaces@] in the UK and Germany. Are there other drivers that, in the intermediate term, actually could cause the International growth rate to (technical difficulty) organic basis be above the domestic rate? Then I had a follow-up.   

JEFF BEZOS: Sure. We're actually very encouraged by the opportunity that we have globally, but certainly, we're seeing at this stage a higher growth rate in North America than in International. EGM is certainly a big opportunity for us, both in North America and in International. As we've talked about in previous calls, we just have a lot more categories today in North America. Over the next 12 months, you will be seeing more categories coming out specifically in International, and we're going to continue to add not only new categories but add selection within the categories we're in.   

So we still think it has a big opportunity, but you are right -- our North America is outpacing International. Certainly, as part of that, North America is certainly been helped by Amazon Prime. We are seeing what we -- certainly, customers are liking what they see there, and that's certainly being reflected in our overall growth rate in North America.   

SCOTT DEVITT: The follow-up is related to Amazon Unbox on TiVo, which seems to be an interesting new product. I was interested in the capacity to increase the content, what you think the constraints are, in terms of the content owners actually providing the content so that you had a significant increase in selection in that category, and possibly longer-term to possibly have a subscription model around that.   

JEFF BEZOS: Well, we have been and continue to be in the process of adding selection. We just recently added the NHL, National Hockey League, and you can expect us to continue to go down that path. It's certainly something that is a core brand attribute for Amazon.com, is Earth's Biggest Selection. There are lots of ways to continue to improve that selection, and you can count on us to do it.   

I can't remember what your -- was there a second part?   

SCOTT DEVITT: Subscription model in the movie category. As content increases, the capacity actually to create a subscription model without the same delivery constraints that a competitor may have.   

JEFF BEZOS: With regard to that, I won't be able to answer, just because it's kind of forward-looking. We'll have to wait and see how that develops.   

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.   

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Good quarter. First, on the Web services side, it's certainly a big opportunity. I guess, can you discuss a bit of when does it become a more material component of your business strategy and how you approach customers on the startup and programming side and, I guess, when it comes a meaningful contributor to the financials?   

Second, just on the digital music side, I guess, love to get your thoughts, as you are in the music category, how the MP3 standard competes against the iPod/iTunes model, and is there an opportunity there as you look forward here, especially with DRM getting out of the industry altogether?   

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of the Web services, it's very early. We're very pleased with the traction we're that getting to date. It's certainly exciting to see, but it's very, very early.   

TOM SZKUTAK: These are the kinds of things -- I think we're really onto something, given the early initial traction. This is a new customer set for us. We've been working on it for just a couple of years now. There are already a very large number of developers using these services. We've gotten very positive feedback from them. We keep enhancing the services. The team here at Amazon that is working on these Web services is super passionate about this -- very, very excited.   

It's going to take -- in terms of your question of when it might affect the overall economics of the Company, it's going to be -- inside a company of our current scale, it takes a long time for new businesses to grow to where they have a meaningful impact on the overall. We have seen that previously with things like International, new product categories and so on. So it's going to require some patience in order to see that have a financial return. But it's certainly just excellent early traction.   

JEETIL PATEL: Jeff, do you think that has the potential to be just as significant as the core retailing business that you're sitting in today?   

JEFF BEZOS: The market sizes are potentially very large. How large it can be, over what kind of timeframe, we will have to wait and see. I think it's premature to speculate about that, but we're going to keep inventing in that area and working hard to satisfy developer customers.   

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Banc of America.   

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA: Would you give us a sense as to how much of an impact the mix shift to media from electronics this quarter was helpful to margins? Then a second, unrelated, how much of the strong International results were related to the UK, given the growth over there, both on the advertising and e-commerce side, has been so strong?   

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of your question around mix, we actually saw very strong growth across both media and EGM over the 12-month period. So I wouldn't necessarily consider it a significant shift in terms of mix. There was certainly a little bit of mix shift within the International piece, where we had media growing -- was accelerated and EGM was not. But in total aggregate, we didn't really see a big mix shift.   

In terms of any specific country -- you were asking about the UK -- we are not splitting our results out that way. We reported on the two segments, International and North America. But we certainly saw solid growth in International with growth of 27% ex-exchange. That's right in the range that we have seen over the last several quarters, has been in the 26% to 29% range. We saw very strong growth in North America, with Q4 and Q1 being really very strong growth versus what we have seen really over the past several years, in terms of growth rate, being 30% and 31% in the last two quarters. So again, seeing very strong growth.   

BRIAN PITZ: Just a quick follow-up on TiVO. Any new metric you could share with us, in terms of 1.5 million subs that are either buying or renting movies or any metrics on that front?   

JEFF BEZOS: No, we don't have any metrics this year there.   

OPERATOR: Justin Post,  Merrill Lynch.

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: If you take the midpoint of your range of GAAP operating income from last quarter to this quarter, I think it went from 3.2 to 3.8, if our calculations are correct. It seems like it's on the gross profit side, but can you talk about why your margin expectations have increased? Are you seeing less price competition in the media categories? Are there any other things that you want to mention that improved your optimism on your operating margins?   

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of the operating margins, we have improved both our top line, our CSOI and our implied operating margins for the year. The reason for that is, over the really last 90 days, we have seen, certainly, stronger growth, which customers are telling us that they like the selection and the pricing and the convenience that we have. So certainly we're seeing the impact of that higher growth, particularly in North America.   

We also saw, as I mentioned earlier, better COGS, again, with our revenue being higher, and we are just getting better COGS improvements, as well as our third-party mix. So those are the key things at the gross margin level, and then we're able to -- in Q1, we were able to leverage our operating costs with this higher growth rate. If you assume that, certainly, a portion of our total operating costs is relatively fixed, and so as we increase our revenue like we did, we're able to leverage that fixed cost infrastructure, which is also helping our operating margins as well.   

JUSTIN POST: Do you have a number in front of you what your NOL is right now at this point?   

JEFF BEZOS: No. It was $1.7 billion at the end of 2006, is what we reported in the K. We've certainly utilized some of that up during Q1, but beyond that, I can't help you with that number.   

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth,  Lehman Brothers.

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: My question also follows up on your margins, but it's more on the going-forward basis. So looking at your outlook, just given the fact that you posted 6% pro forma operating margins in 1Q, I'm trying to figure out what you are thinking over the next nine months of the year, given that the guidance for the full year is 4.7% to 5.4% operating margin. So what specifically could drag down those margins over the next nine months versus where you are now? Or I'm trying to figure out why those numbers are not conservative going forward.   

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of the range, as you would expect, we do have some volatility in our sales rates as you look out in each of our individual quarters. In other words, just based on the guidance that we have given for Q2, Q2 is generally a lower sales quarter for us, just from a seasonality standpoint. As you look at our operating cost portion of being fixed as a percentage of that, it obviously would bring down our operating margin.   

So that's certainly one factor. Then also, there's some mix effects within Q4 being a heavier EGM quarter. But we increased our CSOI and our income, as well as our implied operating margin for the year, based on, certainly, some of the things that we saw in Q1. Based on the range we have given, we're certainly cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year and the total year.   

OPERATOR: Imran Khan,  JPMorgan.

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: First, if I look at your EGM growth rate in the international market, it decelerated 16 percentage points on a year-over-year basis from 50% to 34%. I was trying to understand [if anything] specific into this quarter. How should we think about the EGM growth rate in the international market excluding foreign exchange going forward?   

Secondly, clearly, Amazon Prime was a big success in the US. Are you thinking to roll it out in the international market?   

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of international EGM growth, it was 34%, so it was solid growth for the quarter, but it was down from what it has been more recently. What we did see, though, was on a units basis, we saw an acceleration of unit growth in Q1 for international EGM versus what we have seen in recent quarters. Part of that is this mix that we talked about for third party with the launching of Merchants@ in a few of the countries that I mentioned earlier. So that's some -- so we are pleased, certainly, with the unit growth that we saw.   

In terms of Prime, we are certainly very happy with what we're seeing in North America, and we will have to wait and see what that means going forward, as it relates to other geographies.   

OPERATOR: Jordan Rohan, RBC Capital.   

JORDAN ROHAN, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL: Over the last quarter or so, both Google and Yahoo!, the major paid search engines, have made changes to their algorithms which should, I would think, benefit Amazon and a strong brand in the placement and the efficiency of its paid search campaign. While I know paid search isn't a huge driver of the operating costs and specifically of sales and marketing, can you speak to whether this had an impact on your efficiency, and how you think about it going forward?   

JEFF BEZOS: No. I really don't have any comments related to that at all.   

KIM NELSON: (Technical difficulty) us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.   

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you.   

JEFF BEZOS: Thanks.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth-quarter 2006 financial results conference call. Today's call is being recorded.  

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead, ma'am.  

   TD
KIM NELSON, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2006 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.  

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2007 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2005 annual report on Form 10-K.  

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2005.  

Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Kim. We demonstrated significant sequential improvement in operating leverage, achieving 4% positive leverage in Q4 from -11% in Q3. Operating leverage is the change in consolidated segment operating income relative to the change in sales.  

We increased Q4 the CSOI by 24% year over year, as we grew gross profit by $183 million but operating costs by only $139 million. This marks a substantial improvement in leverage versus the other three quarters of 2006, as we lapped the higher spending in technology and content and gross profit dollars grew faster than operating expenses, driven by accelerated revenue growth.  

In 2006, free cash flow decreased 8% to $486 million, largely reflective of our negative operating leverage during the first three quarters of the year. Sequentially, trailing 12 month free cash flow increased $119 million compared with Q3, an improvement of 33%.  

Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $3.99 billion or 30%, excluding the $122 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in exchange rates. Worldwide unit growth was 23%, and active customer accounts exceeded 64 million, up 16%. Media revenue increased to $2.5 billion, up 25% or 21% excluding foreign exchange rates.  

EGM revenue increased to $1.4 billion, up 55% or 51% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 35% of worldwide sales, up from 30%. For the first time, non-media dollar growth exceeded media dollar growth, even though media grew 25% in the quarter.  

Worldwide gross profit increased $183 million or grew 27% to $850 million in Q4. Gross margin decreased 108 basis points to 21.3% from product and third-party mix, lowering prices for customers and Amazon Prime.  

Worldwide active seller accounts were over 1.1 million, and third-party units representing Marketplace and Merchants@ units sold on Amazon sites, or 25% of total units versus 28% in the prior year. Third-party mix decreased as we transitioned to our new toys, baby and video games stores in the US, which are now, like most of our stores, a combination of Amazon retail and third-party sales.  

Worldwide revenue growth benefited by approximately 160 basis points year over year from sales in these categories. Excluding these categories, third-party units as a percentage of total units increased year over year.  

From an OpEx standpoint, we achieved the slowest growth rate in total segment operating expenses in over two years. G&A declined year over year, which reflects a benefit related to insurance recoveries of $8 million.  

Now, I will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-base compensation or other operating expense line items.  

In the North America segment, revenue grew 31% to $2.21 billion, setting a six-year growth rate record. Media revenue grew 21% to $1.25 billion, fueled by double-digit growth across all categories -- books, music, movies, video games and software. EGM revenue grew 51% to $876 million, representing 40% of North America revenues, up from 34%.  

North America gross profit grew 27% to $532 million, and gross margin decreased 76 basis points to 24.1% from product and third-party mix, lowering prices including free shipping and Amazon Prime.  

North America segment operating income increased 33% to $122 million, a 5.5% operating margin.  

In the international segment, revenue grew 37% to $1.78 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusting for the $121 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 29% to $1.25 billion or 21% excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 63% to $523 million or 50% excluding FX.  

This is the first time international EGM has surpassed $0.5 billion in sales in a quarter. EGM now represents 29% of international revenues, up from 25%.  

International gross profit grew 28% to $318 million, or grew 19% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 135 basis points to 17.9%, which reflects lowering prices, product mix and free shipping offers, offset partially by increased third-party mix.  

International segment operating income increased $14 million or 15% to $106 million, a 6% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international operating income increased 6%.  

CSOI grew 24% to $229 million or 5.7% of net sales. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 20% to $197 million or 4.9% of net sales.  

Our income tax expense was $91 million in Q4, compared to a benefit of $38 million in the prior year that resulted from the determination that certain of our deferred tax assets were realizable.  

Our annual effective tax rate was 50%. Our effective tax rate was higher than the 35% statutory rate, primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg. We expect our effective tax rate in 2007 to be approximately 35% or less. However, there is potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate, due to several factors, including from variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction.  

We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis. In 2006, we paid $15 million in cash taxes, and in 2007, we expect cash taxes paid to be approximately $25 million as we continue to benefit from NOLs.  

GAAP net income was $98 million or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with $199 million and $0.47 per diluted share.  

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $19 million to $2.02 billion. In Q1 2006, we repurchased EUR250 million of convertible debt, and in Q3 2006 we repurchased $252 million of our common stock or 8 million shares. Inventory increased 55% to $877 million, and inventory turns decreased from 14 to 13, as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories.  

Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $109 million from a year ago to $457 million. Our 2006 capital expenditures were $216 million, of which half were software development costs.  

Our return on invested capital was 29%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities.  

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high-level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have euro exposure related to our interest expense on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies, which are settled among subsidiaries.  

Depending on the amount and timing and unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a particular period. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variations, based upon changes in our corporate structure and business operations; the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently nondeductible for US tax purposes, such as stock-base compensation paid to foreign employees; the tax characterization of income earned; changes in current tax laws; and changes in estimates, including accurately predicting our taxable income in the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates.  

Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently.  

For Q1, we expect net sales of between $2.85 billion and $3 billion, or growth of between 25% and 32%. This guidance anticipates greater than 300 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $82 million and $122 million or between a 22% decline and 16% growth. This includes approximately $38 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $120 million and $160 million, or approximately flat to 33% growth.  

For the calendar year 2007, we expect net sales of between $13 billion and $13.7 billion, or growth of between 21% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $355 million and $505 million, or between a 9% decline and 30% growth. This includes approximately $165 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.  

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $520 million and $670 million, or between 4% growth and 34% growth.  

We anticipate our 2007 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year, with some variability from changes in working capital. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $250 million.  

We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share, while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand.  

Thanks. With that, Kim, let's move to questions.  

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.  

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: Could you talk a little bit about your gross margin trends embedded in your outlook for next year? Also, can you talk a little bit about this quarter? If we look at year-over-year incremental gross margins as around 18% on a year-over-year basis, why was it down versus your overall gross margin? Can you tell us what the Toys"R"Us impact was this quarter?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. As you look at our total year guidance for next year, we are not splitting out the individual pieces, giving guidance on the individual line items. So we're not giving guidance on gross margin, for example. But the way you should think about it is certainly, we will certainly have lower prices next year, continued COGS reductions, as well as we think certainly we're going to be adding more third-party sellers. So again, I think those are some of the key dynamics as you look at our gross margins next year.  

Could you repeat the second part of your question? I couldn't hear that.  

JUSTIN POST: Sure. When we look at the year-over-year incremental gross margin, it seems to be around 18%, based on the numbers you report. But some of that was probably due to Toys"R"Us. So I'm wondering if you could help us understand what the impact was on this year's or last year's gross margin from Toys"R"Us.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. In terms of the Toys"R"Us impact, I can't help you, but I can say, from a revenue perspective, we certainly had both retail and third parties as it relates to toys, baby and videogames. That impacted our total revenue by approximately 160 basis points. But in terms of the margin, we are not disclosing the specific margin related to that part of the business.  

JUSTIN POST: Thanks. Good media sales.  

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Comment on two things -- one, your new active customers totaled 2 million in the quarter, which is a decline year over year of about 38%, and last quarter was also a decline of about 13%. So we see an acceleration there. I'm just wondering, do you think that the new active customer growth will continue to decline in 2007?  

Second, I know that 2006 was an investment year. But if I look at 2005 versus your outlook for 2007, it appears at the midpoint that you'll add about $4.9 billion of incremental revenue and only about $31 million of incremental operating income. I just wonder, when do you think the model will show leverage, where an incremental dollar of revenue will really drive incremental operating income and free cash flow?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. If you look at the active customers, it's actually up 16% year over year. What you're seeing is certainly we're seeing, with the revenue growth year over year, excluding exchange rates, you're seeing a 30% growth. So we're getting more share of wallet from customers.  

Then, in terms of the -- if you could just repeat, sorry, the second part of the questions, related to the leverage? That was from 2005 to 2007?  

ANTHONY NOTO: Yes. I'm really just trying to understand -- I know that 2006 was an investment year, and I think a lot of investors, including us, were hoping for some leverage in 2007. But now it appears that your operating income margins will be down in 2007 at the midpoint versus 2006 after an investment year. So I went back to 2005 and said, what has happened over that time period? It looks like you revenue will grow almost $5 billion, but your operating income would not have increased at all over that time period.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Right. What you're seeing is we had an increase in our cost base, both in 2005 and 2006. Certainly, we spent a lot of time talking about technology and content over the past few calls. You've seen that that growth rate has slowed, and so when you look at 2007, you should expect that our growth from an annual basis will be significantly less than it was in 2006.  

But what certainly has happened from 2006 to 2005 is on top of that, you had gross margins coming down. The primary reason for that -- there's certainly a lot of different factors, but certainly lower prices, the mix of categories that we're in. We entered a lot of new categories with new selection, and so that is driving it, as well as we're certainly helped throughout the course of the year by third-party sales.  

So as you think about it going forward, even though you have seen the gross margins come down, a lot of these newer categories are becoming much more meaningful for us. Over time, we will be able to get those margins to be very solid within our business.  

Today, as you can imagine, with some of the new categories that we have, what we're trying to do is get to scale. When we get to scale on those particular categories, good things happen. Think about particularly in international, where we are very, very small within EGM just a few years ago, and now it's become a much more meaningful part of our business. When that happens, we're able to get better -- we get a lot more traffic to those particular categories. When that happens, you get a lot more third-party sellers coming to sell on our detail pages. We also get better prices with suppliers as their volume grows.  

So again, our strategy is to grow those businesses. So we're actually very -- even though you see the gross margin going down, and that being one contributor of it, it's something that we are very happy with, because we need to get the scale in those businesses. Over time, that will be very beneficial to shareholders.  

OPERATOR: Brian Pitz, Banc of America.  

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA: On operating margins, split between US and international, can you talk about how we should think about that going forward? Are they pretty close to parity? It looks like in the current quarter they are, but just any thoughts on 2007 and beyond.  

Then Web Services -- can you comment on the revenue opportunity there, potential timing? Are you factoring in any revenue from Web Services for 2007 in your guidance? Just any kind of updates on that would be great.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. First, on the segments, the operating margins and how you should think about them, in addition to the comments I made about many of the categories that make up EGM in terms of that scale, we're certainly further ahead in scale in our North America segment in some of those categories, particularly, say, in consumer electronics. We have been selling in that category for a longer period of time.  

But certainly, as you think about the two different segments, one thing that you should be aware of -- our third-party penetration overall, we said, is 25%. Over the past several quarters, certainly we have had a much bigger penetration in terms of third-party units as a percentage of total in our North America segment versus our international segment. That is because we have been selling third-party units, particularly Merchants@ units in North America for a longer period of time. With the launch of Merchants@ international, more recently, that's certainly an opportunity for us to grow over time.  

Then if you look at our -- again, our EGM penetration is just a much smaller rate within international. So again, there's an opportunity to improve a lot more from a third-party business vis-a-vis North America. But again, I think we have opportunities, really, in both segments to improve our operating margins over time.  

Then the second part of your question, Web Services?  

JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT, CEO, CHAIRMAN, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Yes. The Amazon Web Services team has a number of different Web Services. They have the simple storage service, which allows you to store data kind of in the Internet cloud, and then it's securely stored and you can retrieve it. It's self-service. It's very inexpensive. Developers really like it.  

There's also EC2, which is the Elastic Compute Cloud. It does the same thing, but with compute instead of data. There's also e-commerce services, there's Mechanical Turk. So there are a number of things. There's Alexa Web Services. These services are getting a lot of adoption, and developers really love them, getting a lot of buzz in the blogosphere, being heavily used by startup companies.  

As far as their impact on the financials, it will take some time before they have enough scale to have a meaningful impact that becomes visible, given the scale of our other businesses. So with a $10 billion business, even though these businesses are doing very well, it's going to take some number of years before they become meaningful. But we're thrilled with the progress, and that team is just doing a bang-up job.  

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Stifel Nicolaus.  

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: The domestic business revenue growth accelerated from 21% last quarter to 31% this quarter. I understand the component that is the toys going to grow. So I was wondering if you could give us a normalized domestic growth rate. But beyond that, there was still acceleration, so if you could categorize where the growth was coming from new categories, the loyalty related to Prime, new customers or otherwise?  

TOM SZKUTAK: The impact on worldwide of toys, baby and videogames was approximately 160 basis points, and that translates into approximately 300 basis points for North America. So if you adjust that from the 31%, you get about 28%.  

You are right. We did see very nice sequential growth versus third quarter, and really all of the quarters was the best growth rate overall in six years. There was a number of different reasons for that, but certainly Prime adoption was certainly one. The fact that we -- as you notice, we worked very hard during the year, in terms of making sure that we had great low prices. We expanded unique selection considerably year over year. In addition to the unique selection, we improved a lot, particularly in the second half, on our in-stock levels. So the combination of all these factors is really what helped the North America growth in Q4.  

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citigroup.  

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: It looks like there has been a fair number of small merchants coming over and tried third-party sales on Amazon. What are you going to get those? Is that purely inbounds, or are you also trying to go out to other marketplaces and attract third-party sellers?  

Then any quick comments on the product results so far for Amazon Unbox, and maybe implications that that could have for broader digital downloading strategies?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. I think from a third-party perspective, one of the things you're seeing is when we had the amount of unique selection that we continue to add, and just some of the category expansion and the traffic to those category expansions, that's naturally attracting more third-party sellers. So that's something I talked about a little bit earlier and something that we want to continue to do.  

JEFF BEZOS: We do have an outreach program, and it's very effective. But most of that activity is inbound. It's people just knowing that they see other sellers on the website, and they want to get their selection into that competitive mix. So the website sort of serves as its own advertisement for sellers. That's a very effective and obviously very low-cost way of attracting new sellers. But the outbound reach is also very effective.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Then on digital, the second part of your question, there's still a bunch of things in our pipeline that we will be rolling out over time. So I encourage you to stay tuned.  

OPERATOR: Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: Could you give us a little bit more color on the dynamics of the gross margins, in particular? As I see it, this is the lowest gross margins you have recorded in the past five years. I understand the rationale you're giving, that you're growing the top line. But the dynamics that you mentioned -- the partnerships, the third-party sales, the lower prices on Prime -- have been with you, [certainly through] the past year. Yet the margins have not been this low.  

So to what degree are you getting the growth from the lower prices? Also, what can we expect, how low can we expect the margins going forward? Tied to that, do you still have many goals of double-digit operating margins?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of gross margin, I think it's -- I briefly mentioned this earlier in the call. But I think the biggest piece -- there's a number of different dynamics, and you mentioned some of them. Certainly, lower prices was certainly one of them. But I think the one that you should certainly take a look at is the mix of products. Again, I think that's something that we actually like. Our non-media dollar growth worldwide for the first time was actually higher than our media growth, from a dollar standpoint.  

Again, what that is telling us, as we look at it, is it's helping us get to scale in a lot of these individual categories. We still have a lot of work to do, to do that. But again, we're starting to see some meaningful changes with such high growth rates, with growth rates over 50% in EGM worldwide. So very, very strong across-the-board growth rates in a lot of categories. So those growth rates are going to help us.  

Then compounded on top of that, as we continue to grow in those categories, is really going to help us get to scale, help us to get better traffic, which will help us get third parties, which -- certainly, the third parties will help us expand margins, as well as get better prices as our volume gets bigger with many of these suppliers.  

So, again, that's what's going on there. That's something that we're trying to do, to try to get that improving over time.  

SAFA RASHTCHY: Any target on the operating margin going forward?  

TOM SZKUTAK: The operating margin certainly, as we said before -- we focus on operating profit dollars, start first with free cash flow dollars, then operating profit dollars. But certainly, we still think there's a lot of room, from an operating margin standpoint.  

JEFF BEZOS: We haven't changed our long-term view about what the model can be.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Correct.  

OPERATOR: Robert Peck, Bear Stearns.  

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: My question sort of ties into Brian's a little bit there. He was talking about the revenue opportunity from Amapedia, EC2, Askville, et cetera. Could you tell us a little bit about what is being invested into that, and when we may see a pareback of some of that?  

As part of that question, Endless.com -- you are doing the negative shipping offers. Some believe that could be a testing ground for Amazon.com someday. Is negative shipping one of the options of where Amazon could go?  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, you are referring to our new shoe site, Endless.com. Through this month of February -- Endless.com, as a standard practice, offers free overnight shipping as well as a 110% price guarantee, 365-day returns and pre return shipping, too. So that's the standard practice. But through February, Endless is offering -$5 overnight shipping. It's an unusual promotion that we're doing to draw attention to Endless.com, so that we can introduce it to our customers. That's working very effectively.  

ROBERT PECK: Is that's something that's on the table that, should it be successful, could be ported to Amazon.com?  

JEFF BEZOS: That's not something that we have considered. This is a special promotion just through the month of February. We're getting such great traction with our standard practices of Free Super Saver Shipping on Amazon for orders over $25, as well as we have equivalent programs around the world. Also, of course, for Amazon Prime members, you pay $79 a year for unlimited free two-day shipping. That program, as you know, has also been met with a lot of adoption. So we are very excited about those, and we haven't considered the negative shipping beyond Endless.com.  

ROBERT PECK: The first part of that question was the investment. Can you give us any sort of gauge to what's the investment in all these endeavors, and when we may get to see some leverage on it?  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, the big investments are in Digital and Web Services. Other things that you mentioned are very minor investments.  

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: As you look at your technology and content investment, about $600 million, can you just give us a sense -- that's what you spent in 2006, but what is intended for the growth of the existing business versus new businesses and ventures?  

If you look on a contribution profit basis, do you think that, just broadly, the e-commerce industry unit economics kind of mirror what you're doing? Or do you think you're artificially surpassing, overall, the unit economics of the business by using a low price strategy? I'm trying to figure out whether your view is that the industry's profitability moves to your model, or you actually have been holding it back for the past couple of years.  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first question, in terms of technology and content, we have not given a split in terms of what is -- if I understood the question, what is the core part of the business and what is for future. But certainly, it's being spent on a number of different initiatives. Jeff mentioned a few of them. Certainly, we're making investments in terms of the incremental spend, which, we're spending that largely on Web Services, Digital, new categories as we launch them, seller platforms, making it easier for sellers to sell. So those are certainly key investment areas for the business.  

In terms of -- could you maybe repeat or restate the second part of the question?  

JEETIL PATEL: Yes. If you look at the overall variable profitability in your business, I guess, is your thesis on your aggressive pricing strategy to end customers that overall unit economics will migrate across the e-commerce market towards your model, in terms of call it about a couple of dollars per transaction? Or do you think that you've been holding it back as a way to grow your volume in the near term in this growth environment?  

JEFF BEZOS: I suspect that what we will see over time is that there will be multiple winners of different scales pursuing different strategies in that regard. So you may see that it probably doesn't end up being one size fits all.  

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, Lehman Brothers.  

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Your results suggest that Prime is really doing what you would like it to do, based on the topline growth, the lower gross margins and also the flattish shipping revenues, despite the 34% increase in sales. So this is a program that has been in place for almost two years now. Can you give us some sense of metrics around Prime, and also discuss the usage patterns during the holiday? Then can you also talk about to what degree Prime customers are more or less price-sensitive than other shoppers?  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure. In terms of Prime customers, what we're seeing right now is adoption is very strong, Prime customers are certainly buying more from us, so we're getting a bigger share of wallet from those particular customers. They're also doing more cross-shopping. Beyond that, at this time, we're not disclosing other statistics or metrics around Prime.  

That said, though, it's something that from a business perspective, we do spend a lot of time on and continue to look at very closely. We like what we see, and so that's something that we think we certainly want to continue to grow that business and subscribers continue to grow nicely, and we look forward to having more Prime customers because we think, over the long term, it's a great win for customers. Customers are seeing that today, and we think it will be great for shareholders over the long term as well.  

OPERATOR: Paul Keung, CIBC World Markets.  

PAUL KEUNG, ANALYST, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: I hate to ask the question again, but it's important, I guess, when you look at Amazon Prime, is the economics of a Prime customer very different than that of the average customer on the platform? I'm trying to understand whether this, in itself, long-term is going to be accretive to the overall platform.  

JEFF BEZOS: Yes. We certainly believe that it is, and we like the trends that we see. They are very positive, and we think, certainly, would be very helpful over the long term.  

PAUL KEUNG: So it's equal or better economics then, is probably the right way to think about it, then, on a transactional basis?  

JEFF BEZOS: Again, the way we're looking at it today -- certainly, we have seen -- we are very pleased at the start of Prime, when we launched it. We continue to see favorable trends. We have found ways to become more productive with some of the volume we're getting with Prime customers. There's things that we think we can do over the long term to make it even better from an economic standpoint. So we're continuing to try to innovate on behalf of both customers and make it better for shareholders over time. But we like what we see so far, and we need to continue to make it even better.  

PAUL KEUNG: The toys category -- how fast did that category grow year over year this quarter?  

JEFF BEZOS: We're not breaking out any subcategory details. But again, the impact of toys, video games and baby was 160 basis points on our total revenue year over year.  

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JPMorgan.  

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Your inventory was up 51% year over year, which is a slight deceleration from last quarter growth rate, but still pretty strong growth. So I am trying to understand where this growth is coming from. Is it toy category or some other categories?  

Secondly, I was wondering if you could give us some color what kind of user impact you're seeing from the introduction of Unbox product?  

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of the inventory question, no, we are seeing -- we continue to add a lot of selection, a lot of unique selection during 2006. So that was certainly a driver. We also worked on improving in-stock selection over the course of 2006, which is why you are seeing the growth that you're seeing.  

Certainly, this is something that will have some volatility over time, but certainly you should expect that over time, it will flatten off to potentially trickle upwards from a turn perspective. So that's how we're thinking about it.  

In terms of Unbox, we continue to add selection at Unbox. We're getting very good repeat customer performance back to our site. So we are very pleased from that perspective. The team is seeing especially strong performance amongst television episodes, as well as hard-to-find video. As Tom just said, of all of our category offerings, it has amongst the highest repeat rates. So we're very encouraged by that.  

OPERATOR: Mark Rowen, Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL: Tom, could you tell us how much video game consoles helped the North American media growth, given the strength in Xbox and your allocation in Wii's PS3's?  

Then on the gross margin, just a follow-up on that. It looks like the free shipping as a percent of revenue wasn't really any greater than it was a year ago. So my question is, was it primarily the promotional environment where you had to match competitive prices from other retailers, or was it primarily mix shift to lower margin categories that caused the gross margin erosion year over year?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of any specific product details of the consoles, we just don't break out that level of detail, from a disclosure standpoint. In terms of the net shipping margin, you are right; it was flat at 3.1%. Certainly, the shift to our new toys, baby and video category impacted that. We talked about Prime impacting that as well. Offsetting that, we had some very good productivity as well. So those were the key drivers.  

MARK ROWEN: I'm sorry? Productivity in --?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Within transportation.  

MARK ROWEN: I'm not asking for the number on video games, but just directionally, did that help the growth rate to a material degree?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I would say it this way. We are certainly not breaking that out, and we had -- within our media categories as well as our EGM categories, as you can see from the release, both from North America and from international, we had very strong growth across the board. Beyond that, there's not a lot I can share with you.  

KIM NELSON: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.  

JEFF BEZOS: Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com third-quarter 2006 financial results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead, Ma'am.  

KIM NELSON, IR, AMAZON.COM: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2006 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.  

   TD
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management views as of today, October 24, 2006 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our 2005 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have a press release in front of you which includes our financial results as far well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2005. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM: Thanks, Kim. I will begin with comments on our financial results. The trailing 12-month free cash flow declined 23% to $366 million, driven primarily by our increased expenditure in technology and content. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 435 million shares compared with 438 million, down 1%.  

During the quarter we repurchased eight million shares or $252 million under our previously announced authorization to repurchase up to $500 million of the Company's common stock.  

Return on invested capital is 23%. ROIC is (indiscernible) free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. Revenue grew 24% to $2.3 billion or 23%, excluding the $20 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. In Q3 2005, worldwide revenue benefited by 260 basis points of year-over-year growth from "Harry Potter 6", plus preorder attachments. Excluding "Harry Potter 6" plus preorder attachments and changes in FX, revenue growth was 26%.  

Worldwide unit growth was 22% or 24%, excluding "HP 6" plus attachments. Active customer accounts surpassed 61 million, up 17%. Electronics and other general merchandise, or EGM, increased to $699 million, up 43%, or 41% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 30% of worldwide sales up from 26%.  

Gross profit grew 18% to $549 million in Q3. Gross margins decreased 113 basis points to 23.8%, which reflects low product prices for customers, greater shipping loss driven by free shipping in Amazon Prime and product mix.  

Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content and G&A combined was $477 million or 20.7% of sales, up 227 basis points. Fulfillment was $209 million or 9.1% of sales, up 11 basis points. We opened a new fulfillment center in Leipzig, Germany which is now fully operational.  

Marketing was $63 million, or 2.7 percent of sales, up 45 basis points. Technology and content was $156 million, up 45% year-over-year or 6.8% of sales, up 98 basis points year-over-year and down 31 basis points as a percentage of sales from Q2.  

We are investing in technology to innovate in areas such as [seller] platforms, Web services and digital. Additionally, we continue to invest an increase in selection. In the last 12 months we have increased selection of unique products carried in our warehouses by over 50%.  

In addition to adding to our category leadership and buying teams for existing categories, we have added additional resources in new categories. You should expect we will continue to add selection over time. We expect the year-over-year percentage growth in technology and content to continue to decrease in Q4 2006.  

G&A was $49 million or 2.1% of sales, up 72 basis points. As a reminder, in Q3 '05, we recorded a $12 million expense reduction related to actual and expected reimbursement by an insurer of certain legal costs that had been previously incurred by us.  

Now we will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense to our segments. In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.26 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $785 million even though the comparison quarter last year included the release of "Harry Potter 6".  

EGM grew 35% to $409 million, representing 33% of North America revenues up from 29%. Gross profit grew 17% to $343 million and gross margin decreased 78 basis points to 27.3%, primarily from lowering prices including free shipping at Amazon Prime as well as product mix.  

The North America segment operating income decreased 67% to $22 million, a 1.7% operating margin.  

In the International segment, revenue grew 29% to $1.05 billion. Revenue growth was 26% adjusting for the $18 million year-over-year favorable effects impact during the quarter.  

Media revenue grew 20% to $757 million or 19% excluding FX. EGM revenue grew 55% to $290 million or 51%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.  

EGM represents 28% of international revenues, up from 23%. Gross profit grew 21% to $206 million or grew 18% excluding FX while gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 19.6%, which reflects price decreases and product mix.  

International segment operating income decreased $4 million or 8% to $50 million -- a 4.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impacts of foreign exchange, international operating income decreased 9%. The combination of operating income in our North American and International segments is our consolidated segment operating income or CSOI. Our segment information in our press release reconciled CSOI to GAAP operating income.  

CSOI declined 40% to $72 million, the decline in operating income was mainly due to technology and content investments. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 28% to $40 million. Third-quarter 2005 operating income included a negative impact of $40 million, related to a patent litigation settlement.  

Our provision for income taxes was $19 million in Q3 and our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate is 51%. Our effective tax rate remains higher than the 35% statutory rate, primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU Headquarters in Luxembourg.  

We expect that these assets transfers to beneficially impact our effective tax rate over time. Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005.  

We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting bases.  

GAAP net income was $19 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with $30 million and $0.07 per diluted share.  

Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities decreased $199 million to $1.2 billion. As a reminder, we repurchased $252 million of our common stock in the third quarter.  

Inventory increased 61% to $736 million and turns decreased 11% to 13.2 as we expanded selection and improved in stock what was across product categories.  

Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased to $449 million. Our capital expenditures were $62 million for Q3 of which $28 million were software development costs.  

Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience, convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. In Q3 '06 we continued to see strong quarter-to-quarter sequential growth for new Prime memberships.  

We continue to see increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories with especially heavy purchases in electronics, kitchen, and health and personal care.  

We launched Amazon [On Box], a digital video down the service offering customers thousands of television shows, movies, and other video content for more then 30 studio and network partners from Hollywood and around the world; and we're pleased to introduce even more selection with our recent addition of Showtime Premium programming.  

Amazon Business Solutions launched [MBeta] Web Store by Amazon and Fulfillment by Amazon, giving small- and medium-sized businesses access to Amazon's order fulfillment, customer service, and customer shipping offers and underlying website technology.  

Our Japanese website launched its health and beauty store, offering customers a selection of over 35,000 items in 12 categories including supplements, drinking water and soft drinks, condiments, processes and health foods as well as cosmetics and products for bath care, nursing care and aroma relaxation.  

Our Automotive Parts and Accessories store now has over one million automotive products offered by Amazon, in leading mass market and specialty retailers. In Q3 we saw a wide range of auto part purchases from air filters, shock absorbers, and handheld diagnostics scanners to a recon engine Ford 302 5 liter Xtreme OHV Remanufactured long block engine that we delivered to a customer in Spokane, Washington.  

Amazon's innovative part finder allows owners of approximately 10,000 different cars and truck models to find the correct replacement parts, performance parts, or accessories for their vehicle.  

Amazon Web services launched in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon EC2 in limited public beta. Amazon EC2 is a Web service that provides resizable compute capacity, making Web scale computing easier for developers. Just as Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon S-3 enables storage in the cloud, Amazon EC2 enables Compute in the Cloud. Developers continue to adopt Amazon's Web services. Over 200,000 have registered to date upgraded in 60% year-over-year.  

Third-party sales remains a key part of our selection expansion. Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately 1.1 million and third-party units representing marketplace and merchants at units sold on Amazon sites were 30% of total units, flat with the prior year. Additionally, our international third-party business expanded with the launch of Merchants@ in the UK and Germany.  

Some pricing highlights include the average customer discount for music purchased on  www.amazon.com  increased more than 350 basis points year-over-year. The average customer discount for DVDs purchased on  www.amazon.com  increased more than 200 basis points year-over-year. And over the past 12 months, customers have saved over $0.5 billion on shipping through our worldwide free shipping offers in Amazon Prime.  

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance incorporated into our guidance of the order trends we have seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there's a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and yuan exchange rates as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events.  

While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand; and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have euro exposure related to our interest expense on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intra-company balances denominated in foreign currencies which are settled among subsidiaries.  

Depending on the amount and timing and unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a particular period.  

Our effective tax rate is subject to a significant variation based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently nondeductible for U.S tax purposes such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees, the tax characterization of income earned, changes in current tax laws, and changes in estimates -- including accurately predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates.  

Our guidance assumes that we won't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.  

For Q4, we expect net sales of between $3.625 billion and $3.95 billion, a growth of between 22 and 33%. This guidance anticipates approximately 225 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange -- GAAP operating income to be between 145 and to $235 million or between a 12% decline and 43% growth. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $35 million. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $180 and $270 million or between a 3% decline and 46% growth.  

For the calendar year 2006, we expect net sales of between $10.35 billion and $10.675 billion, a growth of between 22 and 26% -- this guidance anticipates a small negative impact from foreign exchange; GAAP operating income to be between $339 million and $429 million or between a 22% decline and a 1% decline. This includes approximately $113 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $452 million and $542 million -- or a 20% decline and 4% decline.  

As you can see from our guidance, we expect operating leverage will show significant sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. We anticipate our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year-over-year with some variability from changes in working capital. This excludes the impact of FAS 123R, which could be up to $100 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation being classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows, up from $7 million in 2005. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $225 million.  

We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition -- as well as our free cash flow -- will expand. Thanks, and with that, Kim, let's move to questions.  

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Jeetil Patel. Deutsche Bank.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Two questions. Guys, you historically have talked about just overall profit margins and kind of cash flow margin percentages, not important or indicative of the business's strategy. I guess, can you just give us a sense of how we should think about the operating profile or your kind of game plan in areas like Web services, business solutions and social networking services? And then, I have a quick follow-up.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Certainly when you think of Web services and some of the other areas that you mentioned, it's very early. And so it's certainly something we are very optimistic about over the long term. But it would be -- in terms of projecting anything near term, I don't think it is appropriate to do so.  

JEETIL PATEL: And do you kind of look at those businesses that are kind of in the -- kind of nascent mode today as ways to fuel the growth of the core franchise? Or is it leveraging the existing infrastructure and assets that you have built out over the past nine years and putting them to use in the marketplace? How do you look at new business versus driving the existing operation?  

TOM SZKUTAK: It is some of both. We certainly think that this can be a meaningful business over the long term and can have an impact on the overall economics of the Company. The reason we're doing the Web services that we are doing is because there are things that we've gotten good at over the last 11 years in terms of building out this Web scale application called Amazon.com.  

So as we go about exposing the guts of Amazon, there are other developers out there who require those same sorts of Web scale services. So these are assets and skills that we needed to build for ourself anyway. And what we're doing here is exposing those. And, over time, build that into a meaningful business.  

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto. Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Tom and Jeff, in the past, when we have talked about the fact that we thought your cost of gross was increasing, you have pointed to the fact that you have been spending on elements in the P&L that don't necessarily drive revenue in the near term -- technology and content. As we look over the past three quarters, your marketing expense line has accelerated from 25% year-over-year growth in Q1 to 30% year-over-year growth in Q2 to 50% year-over-year growth in Q3. In your release you disclosed the fact that your marketing expense will be variable with revenue and increase or decrease depending on the competitive environment and other factors.  

So as your tech and development expense year-over-year started to decline, this other line item, which is tied directly to revenue, is starting to accelerate. So I was wondering if you could give us a little perspective on what is actually driving that increase in your cost of revenue? And what do you think about the prospects for that, as you go into 2007 and your ability to get back to double-digit incremental operating margins? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: If you take a look at our marketing expense, it has been in the range of approximately 2.2% to 2.7% over the last several quarters, 2.7% being the most recent quarter. And if you look at what we've done over really the past year, we have added a lot of new selections. You look at the -- in fact, if you look at the unique selection that we have added under our own roof, that is up over 50% year-over-year.  

So what we're really doing is we're trying to make sure that customers -- we've spent a lot of time adding selections; we have spent a lot of effort also making sure that our prices are low. So we're trying to make sure that our customers realize that we have great selection and good prices in the form of advertising.  

So that is what we're doing. And it is still I think in a very modest spend level, being less than 3% of revenue.  

ANTHONY NOTO: I guess it just really begs the question, is it just sort of a transition from the first year invested in the technology to be able to sell the products on your site, and offer them, and now you have to invest in the marketing to be able to get awareness of those products so people will buy them? And when does that sort of transition stop and we can get back to that profitability and return on your investments since your cash flow is still declining?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, no, that is not the -- Anthony, just not the way we are thinking about it. You should think that of it in a -- at least in the recent history it's been in a lower relative range. And again we've talked quite a bit in the past about trying to make sure that we educate customers. And that is what we're doing in this case. I wouldn't think of it as a fundamental shift in any way.  

OPERATOR: Robert Peck. Bear, Stearns.  

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, BEAR, STEARNS: Just a couple of quick questions here. First of all, touching on Jeetil's question there in a different way, when we think about products such as Askville and EC2 and S-3 and all that, can you maybe break down for us what's the incremental spend going to those type of more technological or even social products versus the core development of the platform? That is number one.  

Number two is, could you talk to us about any integration issues or hurdles you have had building the toy store up? If there are any impacts for Q4.  

Then, number three, could you give us more details around [On Box]? Any store statistics you have as far as downloads, streams -- anything else to give sort of a gauge on how On Box is doing versus the other competitors out there? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the question on specifics on spend, we haven't broken out technology and content in terms of the specific details. But what we've tried to do is give you some help by talking about some of the larger buckets. So if you look at the year-over-year increase, certainly investments -- you're seeing investments in Web services, investments in digital, investments in the seller platform, investments in other customer experience.  

In addition to that, that is from a technology standpoint, in addition to that, certainly new categories -- the content piece of technology and content. And some of the announcement that we have made recently in terms of automotive and other category launches are certainly part of that spend as well.  

In terms of your second part of the question on toys, we have certainly been spending a lot of time trying to improve selection in toys. Certainly in a very short period of time both with retail selection as well as third-party selection. So we have been spending time certainly over the past settlements doing that. Making sure that we monitor prices carefully so those two things that certainly have been doing over the last several months -- getting ready for the most seasonal aspect of toys, which is Q4.  

We have over 125,000 unique items in toys currently that we are offering. So those are things and we think over the long term it's certainly going to be -- toys is something that is going to be very good for customers and for shareholders. We are pleased with what we're doing there.  

And then in terms of the last part was on On Box. In terms of any statistics, it is just very early. And we are certainly pleased that we are adding -- we continue to add selection in On Box. And but again, video is very early. We're going to continue to innovative it, innovate on that over time and make the experience even better for customers.  

OPERATOR: Paul Keung. CIBC World Markets.  

PAUL KEUNG, ANALYST, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: First question is on the Toys 'R' Us -- life after Toys 'R' Us, I guess. Looking at the category I was wondering -- looking at where you are today versus where you would have been, thinking about a year ago. You think the category would (indiscernible) in terms of this revenue growth and profitability this quarter in line of what you're going to do?  

And the second question has to do with your third-party business in Europe -- just wanting to get an update in terms of how the Marks & Spencer launch went this month. And should we start to see an acceleration in a number of new customers on that platform now that you have the big one up and running?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the Toys 'R' Us, in terms of the revenue and the profitability, it is incorporated into our guidance in Q4. We are not breaking out the specific number within guidance.  

I apologize -- couldn't hear the second part of your question. Could you repeat the last part of your question?  

PAUL KEUNG: Yes, the second part of the question had to do with the third-party business in Europe. I guess with the launch of the Marks & Spencer relationship in the UK this month, I was wondering if we should start to see an acceleration and adding new partners on that third-party platform in Europe now that the bigger one is up and running?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the third-party platform, we're actually, in International we're actually pleased with it. In the comments I made earlier, we have launched merchants at International for the UK and Germany. So certainly over time you will be seeing more and more partners selling our platforms so we're actually pleased with that. And then in terms of any specific announcements on timing, we generally don't announce specific times related to launches until they happen.  

OPERATOR: Imran Khan. JPMorgan.  

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Tom and Jeff, two questions. First, if I look, you talked about the inventory and stock selection increase. But if I look at the balance sheet it seems like your inventory grew 61% year-over-year, up from 36 and 33 in Q1 and Q2. I was trying to get a better sense like if anything you're seeing into the quarter that increasing your confidence to increase that inventory at that level?  

And secondly, actually probably a very similar question, your revenue growth guidance is guiding an acceleration. Just trying to get a better sense of what are you seeing into the quarter? Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms, and I apologize, you're breaking up in part of your question, but in terms of the inventory increase, up 61%, the two key drivers of that are expanding selection, as I mentioned earlier in one of the other questions. Year-over-year, we have increased our selection under -- in our warehouses it is up 50% year-over-year. So certainly that is part of what you are seeing in inventories.  

We are also improving our in-stock levels. We're having more quantities on hand to better service customers. So those are really two aspects that you are seeing.  

Just as another note, certainly what you have seen in the past as you look at Q3 as a reminder, that we have started to bring in inventory to get ready for the holiday season. So you are seeing some of that reflected in the balance. And then in terms of investment, just also note that as you see the inventory rising, you're also seeing the payable balance rise substantially as well. Our days at the end of Q3, we're 53 days -- excuse me, at the end of Q2. At the end of Q3 there were 63 days. And then it was also up year-over-year from 58 days to 63 days.  

IMRAN KHAN: And with regards to the revenue growth acceleration guidance? I'm trying to get a sense, understand the confidence level about the Q4 guidance?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, the range that we have given for Q4 is 22% to 33%. As I had mentioned that also includes favorable exchange of approximately 225 basis points. So that is the range that we have given. We are cautiously optimistic as we enter Q4 because of the selection that we have added which relates back to the inventory question, the in stock improvement that we are working on as well as throughout the year, the lower prices.  

In addition, with the Amazon Prime certainly becoming more meaningful, having Amazon Prime customers certainly taking advantage of all the selection that we have, for the first time toy customers will be able to have the advantage of that during Q4 as well as super saver shipping.  

So all of those things we think are reflected in the guidance that we have given today.  

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney. Citigroup.  

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Could you talk about what kind of impact we could see on margins from the rollout of Merchants@ internationally? Or maybe a way to get at that would be -- could you maybe break out what percentage of units sold internationally would be third-party versus your overall average?  

And then, secondly, just a brief comment on the operating income guidance for the fourth quarter. While you sort of slightly -- while you increased your revenue guidance for the fourth quarter you just slightly -- but you did lower your operating income guidance. Was there something you saw that made you more concerned about margins or less confident about margins in the December quarter? Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question, in terms of Merchants@, it is difficult to predict what the ultimate third-party mix will be in each of our geographies. What we have said in the past is that, certainly, as you look at our overall third-party units as a percentage of total worldwide, that we are further ahead in North America than we are in international. And certainly the launch of Merchants@ international in the countries that I have mentioned well certainly help that over time from a third-party mix standpoint.  

So again, difficult to predict exactly where that is going to end up. Ultimately the customer will decide. But we will continue to add retail selection as well as third-party selection. And again, the Merchants@ will help us do that.  

In terms of the guidance on CSOI, we actually tightened the range a little bit from what we gave you 90 days ago. The CSOI guidance for the year was 430 to 560. We tightened that during this guidance period to be 452 to 542. So we increased the lower end of the range by 22. We decreased the top end of the range by 18. So the midpoint increased slightly on the year.  

You are right. Given the fact that we exceeded the midpoint for Q3 by a little bit, you are seeing Q4 come down slightly.  

But again, the way that I am thinking about it is, it is a slight increase on the year with strong sequential leverage in Q4, which we feel good about.  

OPERATOR: Safa Rashtchy. Piper Jaffray.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: First, on that last point on the leveraging you mentioned in Q4, how much of it is due to the normal seasonality that you always see? And how much of it is because of the lower spending that you're planning to do?  

Second, beyond Q4, could you give us some outlook or guidance as to what factors will be impacting margins going forward? In the past, you have indicated that you were continuing to spend and increase spending as a percentage of sales, especially on technology, as you had a number of initiatives. Have we reached a stability level for those? And how should we look at the margins going forward? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Q4, when you look at our Q3 technology and content spend, you can see that the growth rate declines where we -- versus what we have seen recently. And on a percentage of revenue it actually declined versus Q2.  

For Q4 you should expect the growth rate will decline further but still growing. And so that is certainly one of the key drivers from a leveraged standpoint. The other one, certainly as you mentioned, I wouldn't view it as seasonal, but I view it as the growth rate. Certainly when you look at the range of growth that we are expecting, the growth rate is also helping us get leverage in Q4. So those are really the key drivers as it relates to Q4.  

And then in terms of going forward, we are not giving guidance consistent with what we did last year. We're not giving guidance beyond Q4. So, but in terms of you mentioned technology and content, what we have said over the last few quarters and consistent with that, we said that we will continue to grow technology and content. But with the deliberate buildup that we have had over the past years, we are going to be growing into that investment.  

But you should expect still that we will be growing on an absolute dollar basis. And keep in mind that when you think about technology and content, it is certainly the technology aspect of that is also a content aspect to that which is adding new selection and category expansion, which certainly we will be continuing to do over time.  

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth. Lehman Brothers.  

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: For the last several quarters, Tom, you have in talking about investing in seller platforms, digital Web services and Search. It seems like this quarter you kind of dropped Search from that mix given the recent scale back in A9. So can you talk about why the change in strategy around A9 and Search? What has changed in the marketplace? And then are there any cost savings involved there or perhaps how you're able to deploy the engineers working on Search?  

TOM SZKUTAK: We still have a substantial investment in Search. A9 was doing a few things for us; and one was still Product Search, which we continue to invest in. And we continue to learn a lot of things from our resources there. You shouldn't expect to see savings from that. We have certainly reallocated some resources to areas that we think are more beneficial to customers and shareholders over time, and that is what we're doing there.  

OPERATOR: Mark Rowen. Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL: Two questions. It looks like your Fulfillment cost deleveraged by about 20 basis points year-over-year and that is the first time that has happened in a while. Is that because of the new facility in Europe? And do you expect that deleveraging to continue for a few quarters until you build into the capacity?  

And then second in the toy business, Wal-Mart just talked about how that was one of the categories they were going to be very aggressive on and rolling back prices on certain items. Do you feel you need to meet them on price? Or is your offering more about selection and you don't have to worry too much about the limited items that they are going to have at very cheap prices?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question related to Ops , certainly one piece of that is capacity. You mentioned the facility. It is our -- we are operational in Leipzig, Germany, which is certainly a piece of that. Other things that are going there, I mentioned the selection that we have been adding as well as improving in-stocks. And you can see the build up in inventory. Certainly those are all factors that are also impacting our operations' costs as a percentage of revenue.  

In terms of your specific questions -- the second part of your question, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about any specific company. So I can't help you with that one.  

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt. Stifel Nicolaus.  

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: I had two questions. First, on the Fulfillment Center utilization, practically domestic. You have added groceries, toys, jewelry, and third-party Fulfillment services just in the past year. And I'm wondering if there's going to be a need for additional capacity in terms of actual Fulfillment Centers over the next year? Or if you can meet the increased selection with the infrastructure you have? And then I had one follow-up.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. In terms of any type of guidance for next year, we are not providing. We will certainly look at -- we learn a lot as we go through our seasonal time of the year so we'll be going through that, obviously, in the next few months. And so, as we go through that can learn from what we see, we will certainly make our plans more specifically for next year. And we can update you as we go there.  

I'm sorry; you had a second part to your question?  

SCOTT DEVITT: Related to the lower gas prices and on the consumer-facing side of your business, have you noted any short-term increase in consumer purchasing patterns that would have been reflected in your fourth-quarter guidance would be the first question. And then on a longer term basis, if energy prices were to stabilize at lower prices, what would it take to have the impact on your back end logistics costs in terms of re-negotiations for the logistics providers?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question, I don't think we are a great bellwether for the economy. But certainly any of the recent trends as well as the trends that we think will happen into Q4 reflected in our guidance.  

OPERATOR: And our last question today will be from Heath Terry from Credit Suisse.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: You have often talked about this ultimately being a 10% operating margin business. With all the changes in the business over the years, as well as this focus on services, is that still the case? Or have those expectations changed?  

And then on a shorter term basis, as you start building out the toy inventory, and building your relationships with suppliers in that category, can you talk to us about what your experience has been and whether you have been able to get the kind of inventory commitments that you want, particularly on the hot toys for the season?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question related to operating margins, the way we think about it, as a reminder, is we are trying to maximize free cash flow and free cash flow per share. So that is forefront what we are trying to do over the long term.  

So as it relates to operating margins, it is difficult to see where they will end up. Certainly, as we were talking about earlier as it relates to third-party mix, we are going to continue to add retail selection, we are going to continue to add third-party selection; and ultimately the customers are going to dictate what that mix will be, which will also certainly have an impact on our operating margins.  

So that is how we think about it. Where we will end up is difficult to say. But whether it is a double-digit or a high-single digit is hard to say. But certainly our goal is to maximize free cash flow and free cash flow per share.  

As it relates to toys, could you just repeat the second part of your question as it relates to toys?  

HEATH TERRY: I was just saying that as you have started to build out the supplier relationships and buying inventory for this holiday season, can you talk to us about what your experience has been, particularly with regard to being able to get the type of inventory, hot toys and such that you would actually want for -- and pricing -- that you would want for the business?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, we have been in the toy business for some time as a provider. We've also had in terms of relationships, we certainly have some relationships outside of the U.S. as we have toy categories launches outside of the U.S.  

And in terms of getting into specific details, I don't think it is appropriate on a vendor by vendor basis or anything like that. But we are certainly pleased with the selection we have. We have added a lot of selection in a very short period of time -- over 125,000 unique items. Customers are going to benefit from that selection during Q4. They are also going to benefit from having -- prime customers will have the benefit of getting product toys shipped quickly to their home or office. Or families -- offer Free Super Saver Shipping. Which again, those are things that will be very helpful to toy customers.  

And so we will continue to add selections over time in that category.  

KIM NELSON: Thanks, Heath, and thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations Web site at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you.  

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMAZON.COM: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com second-quarter 2006 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.  

For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Kim Nelson. Please go ahead.  

   TD
KIM NELSON, DIRECTOR OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q2 2006 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.  

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, July 25, 2006, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC. including our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides 2 accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2005.  

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Kim. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow declined 23% to $375 million. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. The primary driver of the free cash flow decline was our increased expenditure in technology and content.  

Free cash flow was also reduced by a $40 million patent litigation settlement in third quarter 2005, $34 million from excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation now classified as financing cash flows, and investments in additional fulfillment capacity. The termination of our contract with Toysrus.com and related fee disputes had a negative impact on trailing 12-month free cash flow of $20 million. We're working to maximize free cash flow per share over the long term.  

The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 443 million shares compared with 438 million, up 1%. Stock-based awards outstanding were 24 million or 5.8% of shares outstanding, down from 26 million or 6.3% of shares outstanding. We strive to efficiently manage share count.  

Return on invested capital was 23%. ROIC is TTM-free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. Revenue grew 22% to $2.14 billion, or 23% excluding the $24 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Worldwide unit growth of 25% -- third-party units representing marketplace and [merchant-sold] units sold on Amazon sites were 29% of total units, up from 28%.  

Active customer accounts representing customers who have ordered in the past year surpassed 59 million, up 18%. Electronics and other general merchandise, or EGM, increased 37% to $624 million, or 38% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 29% of worldwide sales, up from 26%.  

Gross profit grew 13% to $509 million in Q2 and gross margin decreased 187 basis points to 24%, primarily due to the wind-down and termination of our contract with Toysrus.com, lower product prices for customers and greater shipping loss driven by free shipping and Amazon Prime.  

Now we'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content, and G&A combined was $429 million or 20.1% of sales, up 192 basis points. Fulfillment was $182 million or 8.5% of sales, down 18 basis points. In 2006, we expect to increase our fulfillment space less than in 2005 to expand our capacity to satisfy peak demand.  

Marketing was $52 million or 2.4% of sales, up 11 basis points. Technology and content was $151 million, up 63% year over year or 7.1% of sales, up 177 basis points. We have invested in technology to innovate in areas such as seller platform, Web services and digital.  

Additionally, we continue to invest in increasing selection. In the last 12 months, we have increased selection of unique products carried in our warehouses by 48%. In addition to adding to our category leadership and buying teams for existing categories, we have added additional resources in new categories such as our Grocery store at Amazon.com and our Sporting Goods store in Germany. You should expect we will continue to focus on selection over time.  

We're looking forward to the coming decrease in our year-over-year growth rate in technology and content spending in the second half of 2006.  

G&A was $44 million or 2.1% of sales, up 22 basis points.  

As a reminder, in Q2 '05, we reported a $3 million expense reduction related to the favorable resolution of one of our previously outstanding legal matters.  

Now we will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense for our segments. In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.16 million, or 23% excluding the $20 million impact from Toysrus.com. Media revenue grew 15% to $730 million, and EGM revenue grew 32% to $365 million, representing 32% of North America revenues, up from 29%.  

Gross profit grew 11% to $309 million, and gross margin decreased 224 basis points to 26.7%. 170 basis points of the 224 basis point decline was due to the termination of our Toysrus.com contract. Other drivers were lower prices, including free shipping and Amazon Prime, as well as product mix. These effects were partially offset by increases in unit volume and the year-over-year increase in third-party sales in our mix.  

North America segment operating income decreased $47 million to $25 million, a 2.1% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $982 million. Revenue growth was 27%, adjusting for the $25 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 17% to $718 million, or 20% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue grew 45% to $259 million, or 48% excluding FX. EGM represents 26% of international revenues, up from 22%.  

Gross profit grew 16% to $200 million or grew 19% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 132 basis points to 20.4%. The decrease in gross margin is primarily from free shipping, price reductions and mix shift.  

International segment operating income decreased $5 million to $55 million, a 5.6% operating margin. Excluding FX, international operating income decreased 4%. The decrease in international segment operating income is primarily due to lower prices, including free shipping, and increases in operating expense, particularly technology and content.  

The combination of operating income in our North America and international segments is our consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI. Our segment information in our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI declined 39% to $80 million. The decline in operating income was mainly due to technology and content investment, lower prices, including free shipping and Amazon Prime, and $20 million from the contract termination.  

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 55% to $47 million.  

Our provision for income taxes was $32 million in Q2 or a 59% rate for the quarter, which includes a $4 million year-to-date adjustment to reflect our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate of 51%. Our effective tax rate remains higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg. We expect these asset transfers to result in tax expense for financial reporting above the 35% statutory rate throughout 2006 and beneficially impact our effective tax rate over time.  

Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.  

GAAP net income was $22 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with $52 million and $0.12 per diluted share.  

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $94 million to $1.4 billion. Inventory increased 36% to $521 million and turns decreased 6% to 14.3 as we continue to focus on availability and selection and took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors. We will continue to focus on availability and selection and to increase our mix of direct buying in existing and new product categories, enabling us to offer even lower prices to customers.  

Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased 52% from a year to $405 million. Our capital expenditures were $58 million for Q2, of which $27 million were software development costs.  

Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience, convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress includes Amazon Prime. Membership in Amazon Prime more than doubled from year end. In Q2 '06, we also saw a strong quarter-to-quarter sequential growth for new prime memberships. We continue to see increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories, with especially heavy purchases in electronics, kitchen, and health and personal care.  

We launched our new Toy and Baby stores on  www.amazon.com  featuring tens of thousands of products offered by Amazon and leading mass market and specialty retailers. This is the largest selection of toy and baby products ever offered through Amazon.com. And for the first time ever, toy and baby products are eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime.  

We launched a Grocery store on Amazon.com, with over 14,000 dry goods grocery products across more than 1200 brands, all eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime.  

Our German website launched its Sporting Goods store, offering customers a selection of thousands of sporting goods in over 25 categories in top brands like Adidas, Burton, Nike, Puma, Quiksilver and Salomon.  

Amazon Enterprise Solutions extended its agreement with Target.com through August 2010 and launched a new Sears Canada-branded website, providing Sears Canada with the tools and services to control its brand, merchandising and online business using Amazon Enterprise Solutions technology.  

Amazon S3, a simple storage service for software developers, gained momentum in its first full quarter after launch, providing businesses of all sizes, from Microsoft to SmugMug, with a Web services solution for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the Web. Developers continue to adopt Amazon's Web services. Over 180,000 have registered to date, up greater than 60% year over year.  

Third-party sellers remain a key part of our selection expansion, and worldwide active seller accounts, merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months, exceeded 1.08 million, up 10% year over year.  

Some pricing highlights include the average customer discount across books, music and video products purchased on  www.amazon.com  increased more than 250 basis points year over year. Amazon.co.jp increased its customer discount on pre-order new-release up to 25%. Over the past 12 months, customers have saved over $0.5 billion on shipping through our worldwide free shipping offers and Amazon Prime.  

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and won exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have euro exposure related to our interest expense on this euro-denominated debt.  

We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with inter-Company balances denominated in foreign currencies, which are settled among subsidiaries.  

Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a particular period.  

Our effective tax rate in 2006 is subject to significant variation based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently nondeductible for U.S. tax purposes, such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees, the tax characterization of income earned, changes in current tax laws and changes in estimates, including accurately predicting our taxable income in the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates.  

Our guidance assumes that we won't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently.  

For Q3, we expect net sales of between $2.17 billion and $2.33 billion, a growth of between 17 and 25%. GAAP operating income could be between 7 and $42 million or between 87% decline and a 24% decline. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $38 million.  

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $45 million and $80 million or between a 63% decline and a 34% decline. For calendar 2006, we expect net sales of between $10.15 billion and $10.65 billion, a growth of between 20 and 25%. This guidance anticipates a small negative impact from foreign exchange.  

GAAP operating income could be between $310 million and $440 million or between a 28% decline and 2% growth. This includes approximately $120 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 430 and $560 million or a 24% decline and 1% decline.  

As you can see from our Q3 and total-year guidance, we expect operating leverage will show significant improvement in the fourth quarter.  

We expect our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year over year. This excludes the impact of FAS 123R, which could be up to $100 million of excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation being classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows, up from $7 million in 2005. And we expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $225 million.  

We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We're confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well as our free cash flow, will further expand.  

Thanks, and with that, Kim, let's move to questions.  

KIM NELSON: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question?  

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: A couple of questions. If you take the midpoint of the CSOI range from the last quarter to this quarter and adjust for the Toys "R" Us impact of 50 million, it gets to about a 35 million swing from 580 million to 545 million. Can you just reconcile -- is that all the toy category buildout kind of scaling up in that category, or is there something else that is really driving that?  

Second, you talked about Web services, about 180,000 developers. When do you think you start to meaningfully monetize those 180,000 developers and the initiatives that they're up to to kind of built out their own services around the Amazon ecosystem?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the guidance question, you are right -- we increased the revenue guidance to 10.15 billion to 10.65 billion. And in the bottom, we gave a range for CSOI of 430 to 560, which, again, on the bottom end of that range is down 85 million from last time. The reason why it is down from last time is because of the heavy investment in toys, which certainly includes the termination of the contract, as well as being more aggressive on prices in all of our categories. So that's really the delta on the bottom line.  

In terms of Web services, we are very excited about what we see so far. It is still very, very early for us. And we think certainly from a return perspective, certainly we're looking at it over the long term, but we are extremely encouraged from what we see so far.  

JEETIL PATEL: You provide the base level infrastructure in the Web services area. I guess are you also looking at the SKUs and the product detail pages that you have on the platform as the monetization engine for these developers? Or is there another monetization engine to help them kind of subsidize or generate revenues off of their initiatives?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, for part of our Web services, it is exactly as you say. But then there are Web services like Amazon S3, the simple storage service, that has gotten traction that has vastly exceeded our expectations and continues to grow. So we are super-excited about that. That is a completely different model, where we monetize it by literally charging for the Web service directly. And then the developers who use those services will monetize them and do monetize them by charging subscription fees to their own on-demand applications.  

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Jeff, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on Amazon's long-term vision and how you would sort of qualify the way you think you can differentiate the brand going forward. I mean, there's a lot we read about in the papers, and obviously there's a lot of initiatives that have happened in the last quarter. And I just wonder if we could revisit that as we have seen you announce, obviously, groceries -- there's a lot of talk around a lot of other things as it relates to the media categories and digital strategy. And on your site, there's a lot of new videos and other entertainment types of contents as opposed to pure product sales.  

And then Tom, my question is you guys have talked about maximizing free cash flow dollars. And I definitely understand the impact from Toys "R" Us on your lower operating income for the fourth quarter. I don't necessarily see the benefit from lowering prices further, because it results in a pretty significant pickup in revenue. 25% revenue growth is an acceleration, that's really a positive. But it looks like it is coming at the cost of operating income, and therefore free cash flow relative to what you would have thought excluding Toys "R" Us. I was wondering if you could comment on that. Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Sure. Our strategy for our business is a three-fold with respect to finding the elements that matter to customers that are durable in time where we can build flywheels that we can continue to put energy into. The three big flywheels are selection, price and availability.  

So if you look at each of those, we know that 10 years from now, customers will still care about selection. We know they will still care about availability and price. They'll want to get their products quickly. So the energy that we put into building those flywheels today will continue to pay dividends, even 10 years from now.  

So the price one is very straightforward. The more scale we have, the better our cost structure, both on the variable side with COGS and because we get to leverage our fixed expense as well. So there, we will have the ability to offer lower prices. And that makes the Company scale increase, which again allows us to keep spinning that flywheel and further drive down costs and prices and so on.  

With availability, you see a similar flywheel. As you have a distributed node fulfillment center network, you get to put products closer to customers. And that makes it possible to economically do outbound transportation for things like Amazon Prime.  

So the fact that we have a big multi-node network and that we have the volume to economically support a multi-node network puts us in a very unique and differentiated position to offer a membership program like Amazon Prime to economically afford to do things like Free Super Saver Shipping, etc. So availability is another one.  

And then selection has a similar thing. You see that the number of in-stock ASINs that we have under our own roof is up very dramatically year over year -- more than 40%. And that is, again, in order to be able to do that, you need a certain amount of volume because when you look at those low-turn ASINs in the tail, you need to have enough volume that you can afford to carry even those slow-moving ASINs and make them available to customers on a very rapid basis.  

The third-party strategy also plays into that selection point, where the more customer volume we have, the more flow we have, the more active customers, the more third-party sellers want to interact with that customer flow. And then, Tom, I think you were going to --  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Just to add on to the -- I think Jeff answered a good portion of the second part of your question, Anthony, with his answer as well, in terms of the pricing strategy. But you're absolutely right, it is -- pricing in the short term is expensive. But it has the benefits that Jeff described as he talked about the flywheel as it relates to pricing. It gives us the ability over the long term to have a bigger scale, to get better COGS reductions. It has the ability to leverage our fixed cost structure better as well.  

So as you think about our guidance and the pricing piece specifically, that is exactly how we're thinking about it. And in addition to that, the way you should think about it is it's existing categories plus new categories. As we launch these new categories, we want to make sure that we get the scale quickly to get some of the benefits that Jeff described. And so that is what we intend on doing. And that is the rationale.  

ANTHONY NOTO: Tom, do you think the forecasted acceleration in revenue growth to 25% year over year, which is faster than this quarter and the third quarter, and a seasonally stronger growth rate of 65% compared to last year at 60, is completely due to the lower prices? Or is it also due to groceries and other categories you may not have announced yet?  

TOM SZKUTAK: It is due to a number of things that we talked about. We are investing heavily in the toy category for the second half. It's the -- some of the new categories we have launched. We are expanding selection in the existing categories. We're putting more selection under our own roof, which we also think is helpful, as well as the pricing. But in terms of what I was describing with the impact on the bottom line, and those are the elements, but certainly on the top-line perspective, it is pricing, additional selection and new categories.  

OPERATOR: Mark Rowen, Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL: When you do your own toys, is that going to cause your gross margin to drop significantly in the back half of the year from where it was, given that your third-party gross margins were probably higher?  

JEFF BEZOS: Yes, we haven't broken out the full financials on our relationship with TRU, or we don't give guidance on any specific category. And so, as we look forward, we certainly have reflected what we think will happen in the toys category in the guidance that we have given for both Q3 and the total year.  

MARK ROWEN: Well, I guess the reason I'm asking is with the lower reported operating margin that you guided to, is that primarily a function of gross margin or higher expenses?  

JEFF BEZOS: Yes, it is, again, it incorporates all of the factors that we have seen to date and what we expect for the second half. But the investment specifically in toys, as we talk about it, is a number of different things. It is certainly an investment in the people to run that category. It is an investment in the selection, which we have built up very quickly to launch in early July, and we'll continue to add to that selection over time.  

It is an investment in the fact that we will offer -- we're offering today free shipping -- Super Saving Shipping, as well as free shipping through Amazon Prime. So that's certainly a significant investment, as well as we want to make sure that we have very competitive pricing as we launch this new category for us on our detail pages. So it is a combination of all of those. And that is what is reflected in both our Q3 and total-year guidance.  

MARK ROWEN: And do you think in the toy category that you'll be able to sell as many toy units as Toys "R" Us did? Or is it going to take time to build up the customer awareness -- in other words, did the Toys "R" Us brand attract a certain number of those customers and unit sales?  

JEFF BEZOS: You know, we are not giving unit guidance on the toy category. But I would say that we are optimistic. We think we are going to offer an incredible experience to customers. We think this is, over the long term, is very good for customers and for shareholders. We are excited about the experience that we can give, not only with the selection, but with the service, particularly with Prime and Super Saver Shipping.  

So we think the total package is going to be great for customers and shareholders long term. We think customers are going to like it short term. We think it is going to be expensive short term.  

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth, Lehman Brothers.  

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: I just wanted to get some more detail on your free cash flow, and specifically the $13 million that you essentially withheld from Toys "R" Us during the quarter. Just wanted to get clarity on how that is being booked in your cash flow statement, and then also just clarify that we're not really seeing that in the income statement. And also, why did you see no real benefit in terms of accounts payable during the quarter? Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of -- first of all, this is active litigation in terms of Toys "R" Us. But from an accounting standpoint, we did withhold the $13 million, so it is reflected positively in our free cash flow and operating cash flows.  

In terms of from an accounting standpoint, there's $20 million of revenue that we did not recognize during the quarter that has also an impact of $20 million on CSOI. So it's $20 million of revenue in CSOI that we did not recognize.  

And then in terms of -- I'm not sure if I understand the payables question. Our payable days were 53 days for the quarter. That is up from 51 days last year. So it is an improvement of two days year over year.  

DOUG ANMUTH: And with the change in accounts payable, is that a positive -- is that a benefit of $4 million during the quarter -- just looking back historically, you have always obviously had a much bigger benefit in the second quarter.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we have had -- what you are probably looking at is, and you can see it in some of the timing, the two-day improvement year over year actually was very solid compared to most of the quarters over the past several quarters. If you look at Q1 year over year, it was actually a little bit better improvement, which is closer to four days, which was probably the best we have had in several quarters.  

So again, it was still a very good improvement and year over year, and again, 53 versus 51 days. It also improved sequentially from 48 to 53 days. So again, it was I think a solid improvement year over year.  

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.  

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: I noticed that the shipping costs went up from 21% growth last quarter to 27% growth this quarter. I am assuming that's for Amazon Prime. Can you talk a little bit about the benefits of Amazon Prime? What do those customers give you that the non-Prime customers give you? And why are you still keeping with the program? And are you still positive on it?  

Secondly, on the media items, more and more media seems to be going digital. Can you talk about any thoughts you have on the margin outlook for media sales as they become digital and if you think there will be any changes to Amazon's margin structure if you bring more digital items to consumers?  

JEFF BEZOS: The reason that we like Amazon Prime -- yes, we're still very positive on it. In fact, we are more positive on it than we ever have been as we see the adoption. It's because we see a lift in sales when people -- their kind of pre- and post-behavior after they become Amazon Prime members.  

The experience that we are giving to the customer is improved because they're getting their products very rapidly. So they get more instant gratification. While they still free shipping, they get two-day delivery, whereas before, they could get free shipping, and they did often get free shipping, but it was with our Super Saver Shipping, which isn't a two-day delivery.  

So really, that is the thing that we like about it -- there are several things -- but the big one is we see an increase in sales from those Amazon Prime members, and it deepens our relationship with those customers. They shop in more categories with us. It is a program that would be very hard for most companies to pursue. It requires that you be a multi-category retailer to do it, and in an effective way. It requires that you have excellent transportation costs. It requires a certain amount of scale so that you can have a multi-node network.  

So it is differentiated. It is something that customers love. It is durable in time. And it creates an uplift in sales. So while this is certainly an expensive investment, it really does build what will be a more important and bigger company over the long term.  

JUSTIN POST: And then on the digital distribution of maybe music and video, how do you see that affecting margins over the long term?  

TOM SZKUTAK: It's very early and certainly difficult to predict what will happen over time. And so certainly it is something that we are staying very close to. But it is difficult to estimate what that impact will be over time.  

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JPMorgan.  

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Two questions. First, if I look at your midpoint of your guidance in Q3 and Q4, it seems like you are expecting significant margin expansion in Q4 from Q3 levels. I'm trying to understand what gives you that confidence, considering you are getting into some of the businesses that have lower gross margins like grocery and maybe toy. So that is question number one.  

And question number two is, clearly, you're investing a lot of dollars in the technology area. Investors or the analysts like us, we are outside. How can I keep the track of, like, your progress? How can I keep track of this scorecard that we'll really see some sort of return on investment of those investments?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. First of all, on the guidance question, if you look at Q3, I just want to remind you, as you look at the top-line guidance, that in Q3 we are overlapping Harry Potter 6. And as we had mentioned last year during our call for Q3, that the impact of Harry Potter 6 on our overall top line was approximately 260 basis points. So we are overlapping that. So -- because you're looking at the growth rates in Q3 and Q4, keep that in mind.  

As you are looking at the bottom line, beyond the factors that I have already described in our guidance, keep in mind that in Q4 of last year or throughout last year, we have built up our spend in technology and content. And in Q4 specifically, we're overlapping that spend. And as we mentioned, we expect that our technology and content growth rate is going to decline in the second half versus first half. So that is what is impacting Q4 most predominately.  

And in terms of the other question related to technology and content, how you measure our progress in terms of output, I think that that's something that you will have to wait and see as we launch new products and services over time.  

OPERATOR: Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray.  

PAUL BEAVER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: This is Paul Beaver for Safa. I was just wondering if you are seeing any pressure from gas prices or a slowing economy? And similarly, will you be able to get incremental leverage from your vendors in this slowing economy?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of -- I will take the second part of your question. I think certainly our leverage with suppliers will certainly be most prominent as we continue to grow. As we get -- that's an up and down economy. As we get further scale in our individual categories and we can -- it just helps our overall COGS. It also helps leverage our fixed cost structure. So again, that's where you'll see it both in up and down economies.  

In terms of gas prices, in terms of -- I am assuming that is on demand -- with the growth rates that we have, I don't think that we are necessarily a great bellwether for the economy. So it is hard to say, but again, I think that's all I have to say on that particular question.  

PAUL BEAVER: And a quick follow-up. What is your strategy with the grocery segment? It seems like a fairly low-margin category to pursue. Can you just provide some color for us?  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, the way we are doing this category is very different from the way it has been done in the past. The quantity sizes tend toward stock-up quantity sizes, which gets the ASP of the item higher. We are accustomed to operating with relatively low ASP items. When you look at the amount of gross profit dollars in an item that we handle profitably at Amazon.com, it can be very low. And that is something -- that is a capability that we have built up over time.  

So we are selecting the items that go into that store to be items that we think over time can build a profitable business for us. And the consumer reaction in these early days to that offering has been extremely positive, in large part because the selection of that offering is already so strong, and it will just get better from here. So we don't just carry a few flavors of Jello; we carry all 80.  

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citigroup.  

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: A question for Jeff. Jeff, when you talked about the three flywheels, selection, price and availability, I'm wondering if you think about the digital media offerings that are out there in the market now, do you sense that one of those flywheels or two of those flywheels aren't there in strength? Where would be the weakness of those three flywheels amongst the existing digital media offerings that are out in the marketplace? Thank you.  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure. Digital will have its own set of flywheels, and we are not prepared to talk about that at this time.  

OPERATOR: Paul Keung, CIBC.  

Robert Peck, Bear, Stearns.  

ROBERT PECK, BEAR, STEARNS: A couple of quick questions around the changing environment around you. First of all, with the eBay fee increase impending, could you talk a little bit about any additional inquiries you've gotten from third-party sellers and how you think that could impact you going into third or fourth quarter?  

Secondly, could you also address the rollout of eBay Express really starting in September/October and how you think that could impact business going forward and maybe some of your advantages?  

And lastly, with Google Checkout, could you talk a little bit about any impacts that you could see from that? Is there any sort of patent violation there as far as one-click checkout? Any comments around those three products would be great. Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS: I would just say that we -- as a long-standing practice, we don't talk about other companies. And we will certainly stick with that. The retail business and the fixed-price business is one that has always had a tremendous amount of competition. These are very large markets. There are room for thousands of winners. And we are customer focused and will stay that way. And that doesn't mean we don't pay attention to what competitors do -- we do. We watch and we try to learn. But we will -- these are big markets and there's plenty of room.  

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Credit Suisse.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: I was wondering if you could just give us an update on the Marks & Spencer relationship in Europe? Where are you guys in the process of actually getting that into production? And also, in your international business, how should we be thinking about new product rollouts there as your international product offerings continue to lag what we're seeing here in the U.S.?  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure. I will take the second part first. In terms of our international business, we think there's still a lot of opportunity to grow and add new selection and new product categories. We've seen some of those launches recently, certainly with sports, as we mentioned on the opening comments.  

So again, we are very excited about the opportunity we have in international. We think there's a lot of selection and new categories to go into. We think there is, over time, certainly geographical expansion in addition to what we have done to date that are high.  

In terms of Marks & Spencer, as we have mentioned previously, we will be launching their website in the second half of this year.  

KIM NELSON: Thanks, and thank you for joining us on the call today, and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.  

JEFF BEZOS: Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you.  

OPERATOR: Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com first-quarter 2006 financial results teleconference. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Kim Nelson. Please go ahead, Ms. Nelson.  

KIM NELSON, DIRECTOR, IR, AMAZON.COM: Hello and welcome to our Q1 '06 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.  

   TD
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2006 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2005 annual report on Form 10-K.  

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  

During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2005. Now I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM: Thanks, Kim. This was another successful quarter for Amazon.com. I will start with comments on our financial results.  

Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 21% to $501 million. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Trailing 12-month free cash flow includes a onetime payment of $40 million in connection with the patent lawsuit settlement in Q3 '05 and excludes $13 million of tax benefits from stock-based compensation that are classified as positive financing cash flows under FAS 123R. Adjusting for these two items, TTM free cash flow grew 32% to $554 million.  

As a reminder, the financial measure we're working to maximize over the long-term is free cash flow per share. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 438 million shares compared with 434 million, up 1%. Stock-based awards outstanding were 21 million or 4.9% of shares outstanding, down from 24 million or 5.7% of shares outstanding. We strive to efficiently manage share count.  

Return on invested capital was 32%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. Revenue grew 21% to $2.28 billion or 25%, excluding the $94 million unfavorable impact in year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Worldwide unit growth was 24%. Third-party units representing marketplace and merchant (indiscernible) units sold on Amazon sites were 29% of total units, up from 27%. Active customer accounts, representing customers who have ordered in the past year, surpassed 57 million, up 19%.  

Electronics and Other General merchandise or EGM increased 33% to $639 million or 38% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM represents 28% of worldwide sales, up from 25%. Gross profit grew 19% to $547 million in Q1, and gross margin decreased 9 basis points to 24%, primarily due to greater shipping laws driven by free shipping in Amazon Prime and our lower product prices. These decreases were partially offset by increased third-party sales.  

Now I will discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense under FAS 123R which we early adopted in Q1 '05. Fulfillment, marketing, technical content and G&A combined was $427 million or 18.8% of sales, up 141 basis points. Fulfillment was $190 million or 8.3% of sales, down 24 basis points. In 2006 we expect to increase our fulfillment space less than in 2005 to extend our capacity to satisfy peak demand.  

For example, we are opening a new fulfillment center in Leipzig, Germany which we expect will be operational by Q3 this year. Marketing was $54 million or 2.4% of sales, up 11 basis points. Technology and content increased 69% year-over-year to $138 million, and we expect this percentage to decrease substantially in the back half of this year. Q1 '06 represents 6.1% of sales, up 177 basis points. G&A was $45 million or 0.2% of sales, down 24 basis points.  

As a reminder in Q1 '05, we recorded an $8 million charge related to litigation matters.  

Now I will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense to our segments. In the North American segment, revenue grew up 21% to $1.25 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $815 million, and EGM revenue grew 33% to $374 million, representing 30% of North America revenues, up from 27%.  

Apparel, jewelry and sporting goods revenue all more than doubled year-over-year. Gross profit grew 22% to $341 million, and gross margin increased 18 basis points to 27.3%, largely due to third-party sales, as well as an $11 million increase in other revenue primarily driven by Amazon Enterprise Solutions, partially offset by Amazon Prime, our price reductions across product categories, product mix shift and free shipping. North American segment operating income decreased $4 million to $62 million, a 5% operating margin.  

In the International segment, revenue grew 18% to $1.03 billion. Revenue growth accelerated to 29%, adjusting for the $96 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 13% to $763 million or 24%, excluding FX, the highest growth rate since Q4 of 2004. EGM revenue grew 33% to $265 million or 45% excluding FX, representing 26% of international revenues, up from 23%. Gross profit grew 15% to $206 million or 26% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 53 basis points to 20% primarily from free shipping, product price reductions and mix shift. International segment operating income decreased $4 million to $58 million, a 5.6% operating margin. Excluding FX, international operating income increased 6%.  

The combination of operating income in North America and International segment is our consolidated segment operating income or CSOI. Our segment information and our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI declined 7% to $120 million or flat year-over-year, excluding the $8 million unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rates. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 2% to $106 billion. Excluding the $8 million impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income increased 6% to $114 million.  

Our provision for income taxes was $45 million in Q1 or a 47% rate for the quarter, reflecting our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate remains higher than the 35% statutory rate, primarily due to taxable income associated with the transfer of certain operating assets in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg. We expect these asset transfers to result in tax expense for the financial reporting year above the 35% statutory rate throughout 2006 and beneficially impact our effective tax rate over time. Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.  

GAAP net income was $51 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared with $78 million and $0.18 per diluted share. Q1 '05 includes a 26 million or $0.06 per diluted share gain for the accumulative effect of a change in accounting principles related to the adoption of FAS 123R.  

Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities increased $184 million to 1.3 billion. In Q1 '06 we redeemed EUR250 million or $300 million in principal amount of our 6 7/8 peak. This redemption mitigates potential dilution of over 2.9 million shares and reduces our annual cash interest expense by approximately $21 million.  

Inventory increased 33% to $538 million, and turns decreased 7% to 14.4 as we expanded the breadth of our product category selections and our fulfillment centers and took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors. We will continue to increase our mix of direct buying in existing and new product categories, enabling us to offer even lower prices to customers.  

Our investment in net fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased 47% from a year ago to $361 million. Our capital expenditures were $46 million for Q1. 26 million of CapEx was software development costs. Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary input to customer experience -- convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. We're pleased to see strong quarter to quarter sequential for new Amazon Prime subscriptions. We continue to see increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories with especially heavy use in electronics, kitchen and health and personal care. For $79 a year, Amazon Prime members get all you can eat free two day shipment.  

We introduced "click to call", a new feature for our US, UK, German and French websites, which allows customers to be connected quickly with a customer service representative who will often already have the customer's account information in front of them saving the customer time and increasing satisfaction. Amazon's Japanese website introduced several new payment methods which allow customers to pay for their Amazon.co.jp purchases with online banking at approximately 70,000 community stores and ATMs throughout Japan.  

Amazon's German and UK websites launched wedding registries enabling couples to choose gifts from millions of products for the households, including kitchen and home appliances, cookware, cutlery, electronics and more. Amazon Web services launched Amazon S3, a simple storage service for software developers. S3 provides an application programming interface for highly scalable, reliable, low latency data storage at very low cost. Developers continue to adopt Web services. Over 160,000 have registered to date, upgraded to 60% year-over-year.  

Amazon's German website, Amazon.de, introduced introduced the Advantage program. This enables increased selection and 24-hour availability for customers by allowing vendors to store their products on consignment in Amazon's fulfillment center.  

We acquired Shopbop.com, a retailer of fashion forward apparel, shoes and accessories for women, featuring products from more than 75 leading designers including Marc Jacobs, Juicy Couture and True Religion. Third-party sellers remained a key part of our selection expansion, and worldwide at the seller accounts, merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months exceeded 1.08 million, up 15% year-over-year.  

Amazon Enterprise Solutions announced two new partners -- Benefit Cosmetics, a subsidiary of luxury group LVMH and Timex. Some pricing highlights include the average customer discounts across books, music and video products purchased on  www.Amazon.com  increased more than 150 basis points year-over-year. Customers have enjoyed our "four for three" offer in books on Amazon.com -- order four books under $10 and pay for only three.  

Over the past 12 months, customers have saved approximately $.5 billion on shipping throughout our worldwide free shipping offers in Amazon Prime.  

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the Euro pound, Yen, Canadian dollar and Yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we're cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Let me also remind everyone that we mark our Euro denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the Euro between reporting dates.  

We also have zero exposure related to our interest expense and on this Euro denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with the intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies which are settled amongst subsidiaries. Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, the income position or cash flows in a particular period.  

Our effective tax rate in 2006 is subject to significant variations based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently nondeductible for U.S. tax purposes such as stock-based compensations paid to foreign employers, the tax characterization of income earned and changes in current tax laws and estimates, including the variability in predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates.  

Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or restructuring-related estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.  

We are appealing a recent court decision that terminates our ToysRUs.com contract, and we are seeking a stay of the termination pending a decision on our appeal. While we believe we will prevail and that ToysRUs.com's claims lack merit, the timing and possible outcomes of this litigation are uncertain, and possible effects of termination are not reflected in the following guidance. If we do not prevail, operating profit could be negatively impacted by as much as $50 million for the year, including as much as $25 million for the second quarter. For Q2 we expect net sales of between 2.03 billion and 2.18 billion or growth of between 16 to 24%. This guidance anticipates greater than $50 million or over 280 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange due to the dollar's continued strength. GAAP operating income to be between $32 million and $67 million or between a 69% decline and a 36% decline. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $38 million.  

We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes a negative impact from foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 70 and $105 million or between 47% decline and 20% decline.  

For calendar year 2006, we expect net sales of between $9.95 billion and $10.5 billion or growth of between 17 and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately $150 million or over 175 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $390 million and $520 million or between a 10% decline and 20% growth. This includes approximately $125 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes a negative impact for foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $515 million and $645 million or a 9% decline and 14% growth. Operating leverage to improve in the second half of the year compared with the first half of the year.  

We expect our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate year-over-year. This excludes the impact of FAS 123R which should be less than $100 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation being classified as positive financing cash flows instead of operating cash flows, up from 7 million in 2005. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $225 million.  

We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth and free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well as our free cash flow, will further expand. Thanks and with that, let's move to questions.  

KIM NELSON: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom.  

Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question?  

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Mark Mahaney, Citigroup.  

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Two questions, please. First, on the Toys "R" Us, is it your expectation that you will get some sort of decision in the June quarter? Is that why you think -- is that why you're sizing that at 25 million, or is it very uncertain at what point in the balance of the year you'll reach a decision?  

Then secondly, could you talk about any trends in your technology and content spending? Are you spending in areas that are different than you have been spending over the last, say, two quarters and just in that second content area?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. I will take the second part of your question first. In terms of technology and content, we're spending in the same areas that we have been talking about consistently, and we are making investments in customer experience, digital, Web services, search, improving the seller platform and other productivity initiatives. So that is the same. In terms of Toys "R" Us, certainly this ongoing litigation and trend predict when that is going to resolve. I think it is uncertain and difficult to say.  

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much. Tom, I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit, your second-quarter guidance for consolidated operating income implies at the midpoint about a 4% operating margin which was obviously down year-over-year and also relative to the first quarter. So it seems like there will be a more significant ramp in the second quarter in spending. Then it requires a pretty meaningful expansion in the back half of the year to about 6.3%. I was just trying to understand what products are you investing in in the first half of this year that we will see from a consumer facing standpoint that could potentially drive that acceleration of revenue in the back half of the year and that margin expansion? It is really hard to have the visibility without knowing those products. Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Just to maybe talk a little bit about Q2 in the second half. In terms of Q2, what you're seeing is Q2 historically is our lowest seasonal quarter from a revenue standpoint. We certainly have lowered prices considerably, which is certainly impacting the bottom-line guidance for Q2.  

We also have, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, higher fixed costs in the first half, and that growth rate will be going down in the second half. So in other words the growth rate in the second half of '06 will be lower versus the second half of 2005.  

So in terms of the growth in terms of individual products and any new launches, we certainly don't -- have not in the past announced any new categories before the launch. But certainly with the growth that you're seeing in Q1, we saw accelerated growth from 22% in Q4 to 24.8%. So we saw some nice accelerated growth and we like what we see. We're going to continue to focus on those inputs that help drive Q1 throughout the year.  

So that is why you're seeing the better leverage in the second half as well as the updated guidance that we gave for the total year as well.  

OPERATOR: Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: My question again relates to Toys "R" Us. Given that you lost the current or last ruling, could you give us some idea as to why you are confident that you would win and why would it make sense not to include revenues or profits from Toys "R" Us and kind of wait to see how the ruling would be?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Again, beyond the filings that we have made to date, we have a practice of not talking about ongoing litigation. I wanted to provide some data in the opening remarks to give some context of how we are thinking about it. I think certainly that that is appropriate. But beyond that, I don't have a lot to say on Toys "R" Us.  

OPERATOR: Doug Anmuth, Lehman Brothers.  

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: I just have two quick questions. One actually does relate to Toys "R" Us. But I'm just trying to figure out why in 2Q you get so much of the impact there of the 25 million potentially? So that is question number one.  

And then the second one is just regarding your hiring, I noticed that it was only about an incremental 400 people in terms of headcount in 1Q, which is a pretty dramatic slowdown at least on an absolute basis from what we saw throughout each quarter in 2005. Is that a pretty fair way to think about your headcount growth going forward?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes. In terms of Toys "R" Us, there is certainly a range of possible outcomes. And so the Q2 impact and the total year, we are trying to give what we think is a conservative look -- appropriately conservative look at the situation there as we know it today. So that is how we are thinking about TRU.  

In terms of the hiring, we are still continuing to hire. As you mentioned, you did see a sequential growth of 400 from year-end to the end of Q1, which is lighter than we have seen in the past. As we had mentioned in the previous call, we made a deliberate decision in 2005 to increase headcount specifically in technology areas. We hired a lot of software development engineers and computer scientists. You will see that over the next few years we want to grow into that investment base. So that is really what you're seeing. So that I think answers your question.  

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JPMorgan.  

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Actually two questions, one going back to Anthony's question. If I look at the back half of your guidance, it seems like you're expecting 66% or so if I take a midpoint operating profit coming second half of this year. That is (indiscernible) like 50 to 55 the last two years we saw.  

You talked a little bit about fixed costs will be basically first half. I was trying to get a sense if you can talk about the quarter from those fixed costs? In terms of the technology spending, it grew 68% year-over-year. How should we think about going to Q2, Q3, Q4? I (indiscernible) see the technological spending slowing that will help them?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. The technology and content, the 69% excluding stock-based comp growth, you should see a substantial growth reduction in the second half of the year versus the second half of 2005. And then the fixed cost piece, could you just repeat that part of the question?  

IMRAN KHAN: So I was wondering if you could give us some sense what are some of those fixed costs that you have in first half but you don't have in second half?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Part of it is just the buildup that you saw in the latter half of last year. So if you look at the operating expense over the course of last year, we have had a sizable buildup through the course of last year with Q4 being certainly the highest. So it is really -- you will be starting to see the lapping of that increase in the second half of the year.  

IMRAN KHAN: Okay. If I may ask one follow-up question in terms of Amazon Prime. You said that you have had pretty good success with Amazon Prime. I was wondering if you could give us some color like how many customers are using Amazon Prime right now and what kind of ASP improvement you saw because of Amazon Prime? Some maybe ballpark color, I would appreciate that.  

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER & CEO, AMAZON.COM: This is Jeff. We're not providing any numbers on Amazon Prime. What I can tell you is that we have seen very exciting growth sequentially Q4 to Q1, even though we came off a very strong Q4 for Amazon Prime. New subscriptions are up even sequentially off of our seasonally heavy quarter. So we continued and we are able to track a bunch of numbers with Amazon Prime in terms of what it does to wallet share and increased spending, those kinds of metrics, renewal rates, etc., etc. We're a very happy with what we're seeing, but we're not discussing those figures publicly.  

On your earlier question, I just wanted to add to Tom's answer just to make sure that you understood. It is not so much that the fixed costs are being reduced in the back half of the year. It is, in fact, those technology and content, for example, will probably go up in absolute dollars. It is just that as the Company continues to grow, the year-over-year growth in those numbers is less, and then as the topline grows, also we start to grow into that cost structure over the next few years.  

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Great. Two questions. First of all, on Amazon Prime can you talk about -- I guess you're seeing frequency growth overall in the business of about 5 to 6% year on year. Can you talk about the impact that Amazon Prime has? Are you seeing even faster frequency growth in that audience, or do you think it's actually attracting a different customer that may not have looked at Amazon previously in terms of the active account base?  

Second question I guess broadly, as you look and take a step back and look at the marketplace, it seems like subscriptions, rentals and also new product purchases and sales, they all represent just different ways of accessing content and information and products out there. How do you see your customer adapting to those different types of businesses or concepts out there? Do you think they are open to different solutions, different ways of accessing content, or do you think that it becomes more of a -- still more of a retail business?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I think our customers are very receptive to new kinds of offerings from us. Over time we have stretched the corners of how customers perceive us, and we have done that very successfully, transitioning from an online bookseller to being able to sell hardlines and now many more categories. At the same time, we have had success with two very very different kinds of business models from a consumer point of view. One being the retail business model and the second one being the third-party business model, which as you know now is a significant percentage of our units where third-party sellers sell through the Amazon.com website.  

So not only have we kind of stretched the corners of how customers perceive us in terms of product category but also in terms of business model. I think what we're seeing with Amazon Prime in our rental offerings is yet another business model that customers are giving us permission to pursue with them. So not only are we happy with the new subscription growth that we have seen in Amazon Prime, but if you look at our DVD rental business in the UK and Germany, those businesses are going very well, too. Having started free trial offers there, we're even seeing acceleration in those businesses as well, and that is off of a base that we were already happy with.  

JEETIL PATEL: Jeff, do you think that some of these business models can still exist inside the same category at the same time so DVD rental, DVD club service versus DVD purchases all in one?  

JEFF BEZOS: Yes. In fact, we have announced that we're going to be doing a program called Upgrade that will allow people to buy physical books and then for a small incremental charge get online access to those books as well. So we do think that there are offerings which can co-exist.  

I would point to our third-party sales business where people can buy the new version of the book or the used version of the book or the reconditioned tool or the new tool or etc. etc. or the new camera from somebody else. Instead of buying a new camera from us, go right from the Amazon website. That is another example of where you have two quite dissimilar business models interacting very nicely even on the same detail page.  

JEETIL PATEL: Do you employ a lot of the data between different products, different business models today or not really in terms of the used pricing versus new pricing, etc.?  

JEFF BEZOS: I'm sorry. Could you say that again?  

JEETIL PATEL: So are you leveraging a lot of the data and knowledge base from what you learn and, let's say, used, what consumers are willing to pay for for a particular product to, let's say, in the content area, what they are willing to pay for by chapter or by different formats for a used model versus a pure buy model?  

JEFF BEZOS: Not necessarily that particular example, but we do have things. For example, we can see which subcategories of books performed best inside things like Search Inside! the Book. So when we offer Search Inside! the Book, which allows people to do full text searches and view certain portions of books, we can see which subcategories of books do services like that perform better in. Then we can think about how can we extend those offerings in those kinds of subcategories. So we do have a lot of very helpful data that we can view and use it as aid in making business decisions.  

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.  

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: I think on the call you mentioned you would be able to cut pricing by about 150 basis points year-over-year to the consumer. I'm wondering if you are able to get better deals from your vendors? Are you able to pass that through, and that's what you're able to maintain the margins?  

The second thing, the shipping expense was up pretty consistent with the revenue growth. Do you expect any pressure from gas prices or Amazon Prime going forward? And then could you just remind me of the FAS 123 benefit that you got in the first quarter?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of impact on [cogs] in your pricing question, yes, it is on ongoing effort everyday to try to get better prices from our suppliers, and certainly our goal is to help pass that on in terms of lower prices to customers. So that is an everyday activity that we do globally.  

In terms of shipping expense, in terms of the inflation that you mentioned, certainly that is something that we have been dealing with for several years with oil prices and energy prices where they are. We have seen a dramatic increase over the last several years. So it is just something that we have been managing over the past several years. I'm not sure what more to say about that. And then the last part of your question, I'm sorry?  

JUSTIN POST: Yes, the FAS 23 benefit that you got in the first quarter, I think you gave that number.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, it is 13 over the past 12 months and it is 7 in Q1.  

JUSTIN POST: Okay. We will get back to that later. Thank you.  

OPERATOR: Robert Peck, Bear Stearns.  

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm sorry, you were talking about expense or the impact on free cash flow? I'm not sure -- you're talking about the stock-based compensation expense or the impact on free cash flow?  

OPERATOR: I'm sorry, Mr. Post. Could you please requeue?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, if he is not back on. The expense piece was $11 million. Stock-based compensation was $11 million in Q1, which was down from $19 million from last year. And then the impact of 123R on free cash flow was $7 million in Q1 or $13 million over the trailing 12 months if that is helpful. That covered both bases.  

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Tom, this is Bob Peck. Am I live?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes.  

ROBERT PECK: Okay. Great. I got two questions for you. The first is sort of a two-parter, though. Are you able to break out your text spending as far as investment versus maintenance, and investment sort of meaning your newer initiatives, not necessarily along the course, just a9, S3, etc.?  

And part two of that is considering a lot of the initiatives you're taking are very similar to things that Google is doing, does it ever make sense for you to consider any sort of partnership with Google? And then I have got a follow-up.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Okay. In terms of our technology and content spend, we look at it a number of different ways. We look at it certainly from a maintenance mode, an investment mode. But we look at it on an individual program basis as well. So again, we're looking at all the individual programs that we do. We review that regularly, so it is part of our playing process.  

In terms of partnerships and any other discussion, you know we have a long-standing practice of not talking about any particular company.  

ROBERT PECK: Okay. Because you can see the synergies there if you did.  

The second question would be on Amazon Prime really quickly. The Amazon Prime subs right now, are they profitable? And with the release of eBay Express, what is your opinion of the impact of eBay Express on Amazon longer-term? Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: We do not as a matter of practice talk about other companies and definitely stick to that. I would say more generally there are going to be and there have been thousands of competitors, and there should be in this space. These are very big markets, and there can be lots of winners.  

What was the other part of your question?  

ROBERT PECK: Are the Prime subs profitable?  

TOM SZKUTAK: They are profitable on their own basis, so that each one is profitable. They are less profitable than if they did that same amount of shopping without getting free shipping. So the two-day free shipping makes them much less profitable than they would be otherwise. So do you understand what I'm saying?  

ROBERT PECK: I do.  

OPERATOR: Mark Rowen, Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL: A couple of quick questions. One on the Toys "R" Us, you're saying that it is going to be $100 million impact for the year if it works out unfavorably to you. I noticed in the lawsuit that they were really fighting about the $50 million payment. So in that $100 million, are you assuming that you don't replace them with another third-party seller or your own sales? Is that like a worst-case scenario?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I don't know where the numbers you are describing are coming from, the 100. What we had mentioned was that it could be up to $50 million for the year in operating profit.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay. So 50 for the year. So is that the excess payment that they made that you could not replace by putting another third-party seller in there, or do you think you could make some of that up if you did put another third-party seller in there with a higher commission or whatever?  

JEFF BEZOS: Yes, Mark, as you can probably appreciate, this is a matter of ongoing litigation, and I don't think it is appropriate to talk further about it. I think we have given adequate commentary in the opening remarks about it. At this stage, I would like to keep it to that.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay. My second question, it relates to your North American media business. A lot of the other sellers of those products, particularly in music and movies, have been struggling over the last year, music probably longer than that. Are those categories still good for you? Are you still gaining share in a shrinking market, or are the effects of the market shrinking impacting those categories? And is it really books that is driving that category?  

TOM SZKUTAK: When you look at the growth rates for North American media, we are still seeing very solid double-digit growth. It is up 15% year over year, 16% on a TTM basis. So we think it is a very good business for us. There has certainly been a lot of innovation and improvements in customer experience over the past few years within that space, which we think is paying off for us.  

MARK ROWEN: So it is paying off in all of those categories, not just books?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we have not broken out any of the individual categories within media, but we are certainly pleased with the individual categories that make that up.  

OPERATOR: Shawn Milne, Friedman Billings Ramsey.  

SHAWN MILNE, ANALYST, FRIEDMAN BILLINGS RAMSEY: A quick question, Tom, on the flow of your business in the first quarter. If you look at some data from the third-party, it looks like online spending was strong in January. It was a bit weaker in February and then rebounded in March. Can you talk about the flow of your business if you saw any of those trends?  

And the March data actually would suggest an acceleration in online spending heading into April. Any thoughts on that? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we have not -- again, we are running certainly a business in a number of different countries. So I don't think it's appropriate to talk about individual months. But certainly when you look at our overall growth for the quarter, you're seeing an acceleration. You saw 22% growth in Q4 on a local currency basis, just under 25% in Q1. So again, you saw an acceleration there.  

But talking much more beyond that in terms of individual months, we're not going to do today.  

SHAWN MILNE: You talked about buying directly more in inventory. Are you buying toy inventory currently?  

TOM SZKUTAK: No, I'm not going to comment more on the toy business.  

OPERATOR: Thank you. For any closing remarks (technical difficulty)-- (multiple speakers)  

KIM NELSON: A replay will be available at our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Amazon.com fourth-quarter 2005 financial results conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tim Stone. Please go ahead, sir.  

TIM STONE, VP, IR, AMAZON.COM: Welcome to our Q4 '05 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A. In the following discussion, responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today February 2, 2006 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, included our 2004 annual report on Form 10-K.  

   TD
As you are listening to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2004.  

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM: Thanks, Tim. This was another successful year for Amazon.com. We significantly expanded our value proposition for customers, and we are grateful to our customers, our global teams and our partners for helping deliver these results.  

Let me start by reviewing 2005 in full. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 11% to a record $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow includes a onetime payment of $40 million in connection with the patent lawsuit settlement in Q3 of '05. Excluding this settlement, 2005 free cash flow grew 19% to $569 million. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.  

As a reminder, the financial measure we are working to maximize over the long-term is free cash flow per share. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 438 million shares compared with 434 million shares, up 1%. Stock-based towards outstanding were 22 million or 5.2% of shares outstanding, down from 25 or 6% of shares outstanding. Return on invested capital was 34%, ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. Revenue grew 23% to $8.49 billion or 24%, excluding the $73 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. North America grew 22% to 4.7 billion, and international grew 23% to 3.8 billion, 25% year-over-year growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.  

Gross profit grew 27% to 2.04 billion, and gross margin increased 87 basis points to 24%. Consolidated segment operating income grew 16% to $566 million or 17%, excluding $8 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin decreased 41 basis points to 6.7%.  

Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities increased $221 million to $2.0 billion. In Q1 of '05 we repurchased EUR200 million of our convertible debt. And as separately announced today, we will be redeeming EUR250 million or approximately $300 million at recent Eurodollar exchange rates in the principal amount of our 6 7/8 Euro denominated convertible debt notes due 2010 at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. This redemption mitigates potential dilution of over 2.9 million shares and reduces our annual cash interest expense by approximately $21 million. Inventory increased 18% to $566 million, and inventory turns decreased from 16 to 14 as we bolstered inventory levels for customers by optimizing in stock levels across product categories and expanding the breadth of product category selection in our fulfillment centers. We will continue to increase our direct buying efforts in existing and new product categories, enabling us to extend even lower prices to customers. Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased $101 million from a year ago to 348 million, of which $87 million is capitalized software development costs. Our 2005 capital expenditures were $204 million, of which $79 million was software development costs.  

Now I will discuss the fourth quarter. Revenue grew 17% to $2.98 billion or 22% excluding $121 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide unit growth for the quarter was also 22%. Third-party units representing marketplace and merchant stat units sold on Amazon sites were 28% of total units, up from 26%. For the first time, North America media surpassed $1 billion, and North America electronics and general merchandise exceeded $500 million. And worldwide electronics and other general merchandise increased 31% to $901 million or 36% excluding FX, representing 30% of worldwide sales, up from 27%. Active customer accounts representing customers who have ordered in the past year surpassed 55 million, up 19%. Gross profit grew 23% to $667 million, and gross margin increased 98 basis points to 22.4%, primarily due to increased third-party sales, changes in the geographic mix of business and a $19 million increase in other revenue primarily from Amazon Enterprise Solutions, formerly known as merchant.com, partially offset by a greater shipping loss driven by free shipping in Amazon Prime, our lower product prices and continued mix shift to EGM. In Q4 we offered free short-term membership trials for Amazon Prime, and although they are expensive, we expect to continue offering these trials for our customer base in the future.  

Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense under FAS 123R, which we adopted early in Q1 of '05. Fulfillment, marketing, technical content and G&A combined was $482 million or 16.2% of sales, up 175 basis points. Fulfillment was $246 million or 8.3% of sales, up 26 basis points. In 2005 we expanded our fulfillment capacity through efficiency gains, as well as increases in leased warehouse space in order to accommodate greater selection in these anticipated shipment volumes from ourselves, as well as third-parties for whom we provide the fulfillment.  

In 2006 we expect to increase our fulfillment space, less than in 2005, to expand our capacity to satisfy peak demand. For example, we intend to expand our warehouse space in Germany. Marketing was $67 million or 2.2% of sales, roughly flat as a percentage of sales year-over-year. Technology and content was $123 million or 4.1% of sales, up 127 basis points as we continue to hire top computer scientists and software engineers to further innovate for customers in areas such as our (inaudible) platforms, search, Web Services and digital. Q4 '05 represents an annual run-rate of approximately $500 million as we enter 2006. In 2006 we will continue investing in our long-term opportunities, innovating on behalf of customers. We expect technology and content costs to continue to grow in absolute dollars and our 2006 year-over-year percentage growth rate to be lower than 2005.  

G&A was $46 million or 1.5% of sales, up 27 basis points. G&A costs increased primarily due to payroll and related expenses, professional fees and legal costs.  

Now I will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense to our segments. In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $1.7 billion. Media grew 16% to $1 billion. And EGM grew 29% to $580 million, representing 34% of North American revenues, up from 32%. Apparel, jewelry and sporting goods revenue all more than doubled year-over-year. Other revenue was up 25% primarily from Amazon Enterprise solutions. Gross profit grew 18% to 418 million, and gross margin decreased 64 basis points to 24.8%, largely due to Amazon Prime and free shipping, products and service mix and our price reduction across product categories, partially offset by third-party sales. North America segment operating income decreased $30 million and $92 million or 5.5% operating margin.  

In the international segment, revenue grew 13% to $1.3 billion. Revenue growth was 23% adjusting for the $122 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange during the quarter. Media revenue grew 6% to $968 million or 16% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM grew 36% to $321 million or 49% excluding FX, representing 25% of international revenues, up from 21%. Gross profit grew 31% to $249 million, while gross margin increased 273 basis points to 19.3%, primarily from increase in third-party sales and from vendor management, including discounts from suppliers partially offset by increased free shipping, product price reductions and product mix shift.  

International segment operating income increased $37 million and $93 million, and operating margin increased 233 basis points to 7.1%. It is important to remember that a significant majority of technology and content costs are incurred in the U.S. with most of them allocated to the North America segment.  

The combination of operating income in our North American and international segments is our consolidated segment operating income or CSOI. Our segment information financial statement in our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI grew 4% to $185 million or 11%, excluding the $12 million unfavorable year-over-year impacts from foreign exchange rates. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased 1% to $165 million. Excluding the $12 million impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, operating income increased 9% to $176 million. Our provision for income taxes includes a tax benefit of $90 million in Q4 of '05 or $0.21 per diluted share related to our determination that certain of our deferred tax assets are realizable. Without the benefit of this change, our effective tax rate was 43% in 2005, higher than the 35% statutory rate resulting from the transfer of certain operating assets from the U.S. to international locations in connection with establishing our EU headquarters in Luxembourg.  

We will transfer additional assets in 2006 to finalize the European headquarters transition, and we will expect this will result in an effective tax rate significantly higher than the statutory rate for 2006. Since we have deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant impact on our cash taxes paid in 2006, which we expect to be approximately $25 million compared with $12 million in 2005. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.  

GAAP net income was $199 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared with $347 million or $0.82 per diluted share. Excluding the $90 million tax benefit in 2005 and the $244 million tax benefit in 2004, GAAP net income would have been $110 million or $0.26 per diluted share in Q4 of' 05 and $102 million or $0.24 per diluted share in Q4 of '04.  

Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs to customer experience -- convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. We continue to be pleased with Amazon Prime results. Subscriptions to Amazon Prime more than doubled from November to December. We have seen increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories with especially heavy purchases in electronics, kitchen and health and personal care. For $79 a year Amazon Prime members get "all-you-can-eat" free two-day shipping.  

Our "Search Inside the Book" technology is now available in six geographies, most recently in Japan, where customers can preview the text inside over 160,000 books. Building on our successful "Search Inside the Book" technology, the digital team also announced it is currently developing two innovative programs, Amazon Pages and Amazon Upgrade, to benefit readers, authors and publishers that will enable customers to purchase online access to any page, section or chapter of a book, as well as the book in its entirety.  

Our German site, Amazon.de, launched Express Delivery in Q4, giving customers the ability to order eligible products by 7:30 PM for guaranteed delivery by noon the next day. Worldwide active seller accounts, merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months, exceeded 1.05 million, up 24% year-over-year.  

Amazon's China site, Joyo.com, in a long-term test lowered the order site threshold for customers to qualify for free shipping from 99 to 200 RMB and offers more than 300,000 books, music, video and DVD titles, making it the largest Chinese bookstore in the world.  

Amazon Japan's site, Amazon.co.jp, launched a sports store with over 100,000 items and more than 600 brands across 17 categories, including baseball, golf and soccer. Some price highlights include the average customer discount across books, music and video products purchased on  www.Amazon.com  increased by over 175 basis points year-over-year. The average customer discount for electronics products on  www.Amazon.com , increased over 50 basis points year-over-year. Customers saved over $475 million on shipping through our worldwide free shipping offers in Amazon Prime in 2005.  

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we are seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the Euro, Pound, Yen, Canadian dollar and Yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Let me also remind everyone that we mark our Euro denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the Euro between reporting dates. We also have Euro exposure related to our interest expense on this Euro denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies which are settled among subsidiaries.  

Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position and our cash flows in a particular period. Our effective tax rate in 2006 is subject to significant variations based on changes in our corporate structure and business operations, the amount of expenses incurred that are permanently nondeductible for U.S. tax purposes such as stock-based compensation paid to foreign employees, the tax characterization of income earned and changes in current tax laws and estimates, including variability in predicting our taxable income and the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates.  

Our guidance assumes that we don't report any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or restructuring-related estimates and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For Q1 we expect net sales of between 2.14 billion and 2.29 billion or growth of between 13 and 20%. This guidance anticipates more than 75 million or over 400 basis points of negative impact to foreign exchange due to the dollar's continued strength. GAAP operating income could be between 70 and 105 million or between a negative 35% and a negative 3% decline. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $30 million. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes a negative impact from foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 100 and $135 million or between a negative 22% decline and 5% growth.  

For calendar year 2006, we expect net sales of between $9.85 billion and $10.45 billion on growth of between 16 and 23%. This guidance anticipates approximately $100 million or over 100 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $370 million and $510 million or between a 14% decline and an 18% growth. This includes approximate $135 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which includes the negative impact from foreign exchange and excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $505 million and $645 million or 11% decline and 14% growth.  

Operating leverage should accelerate in the second half of the year compared with the first half of the year. We expect our 2006 free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to the operating profit growth rate year-over-year. This excludes the impact of FAS 123R, which may result in up to $100 million of tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be classified as positive financing cash flows net of operating cash flows, up from $7 million in 2005. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $225 million. Our strategy is to remain relentlessly focused on customer experience with our financial focus on long-term growth and free cash flow per share. We believe the investments we have made and will make in 2006 in the form of lower prices and free shipping, as well as investments in further technology innovation, are the right investments for future free cash flow.  

In the last four years, we have generated nearly $1.5 billion in free cash flow, while investing $1.1 billion in technology and content, and customers saved over $1.25 billion on shipping since we have made free shipping a permanent offer and introduced Amazon Prime for customers on top of our prices which continue to lower. We will continue to strive for year-over-year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in our long-term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well as our free cash flow, will further expand.  

Thanks, and with that, Tim, let's move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind everyone of the Q&A process?  

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Jeff, in the past you and I have talked about some of the -- I have asked you questions about the structural challenges outside of the books, music and video that I thought were apparent. I was wondering today if we could focus on the books, music and video business. This has clearly been a business that has really benefited from competitive advantages and you being a low-cost operator being able to give consumers lower prices than anyone else and better selection.  

As you think about that business in the next five to 10 years and the impact digital may have on the profitability, do you worry about the profitability of that business eroding given the visual margins are much lower than the physical margins?  

And then secondly, in 2006 it looks like it is going to be the third year in which your incremental margins have trended below the prior year, which means you continue to invest. At what point does that investment end, and we start to see a rise in your incremental margins and return on that investment? Thank you.  

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER & CEO, AMAZON.COM: Sure. Thanks, Anthony, and by the way, I think you had twins yesterday. Congratulations on that. If you look at our digital investment, we are excited about the opportunity there going forward. In the physical world, that is where the vast majority of media products are sold today in physical stores. And as we move forward with digital, we think Amazon is especially well-positioned to capture a bigger part of that business. While media products are physical, it makes a lot of sense for a big faction of them to be sold in physical stores, and I think that there will be sustainable margins there for those players who can create a very good customer experience. And that is what we're working on doing.  

And the second part of the question, I forgot.  

ANTHONY NOTO: It was just that 2006 looks like it will be the third year in which your incremental profitability is lower than the prior year, which implies you are investing again for the future. I am just wondering at what point do we see that investment tail off and a return on the investment hit the P&L, which we would measure as an improvement in incremental margins?  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, if you look at 2005, it was definitely a year where we increased our cost structure significantly. We did that very deliberately, and we did it because we see a lot of opportunity going forward. I do think that we will see over the next couple of years that we will be able to -- we will start to see the utilization of that cost structure over the next couple of years.  

OPERATOR: Robert Peck, Bear Stearns.  

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Following on Anthony's question, could you maybe quantify or shape for us with the investments you are making what portions are going to newer initiatives like A9, Alexa? What portion is going for Amazon Prime? Could you maybe quantify how many current subs you have for Amazon Prime?  

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of the investments we are making, we are making a number of investments that are short-term, intermediate and longer-term, and we have not quantified the pieces, but certainly you should look at the investment we are making in A9.com as being longer-term. Digital Web Services is certainly longer-term initiatives for us.  

But again, we are making a number of different initiatives. Amazon Prime certainly is one that we are investing in today. It is expensive. That being said, the early results that we see we like. We are seeing the customers that are Amazon Prime members are shopping more, they are doing more cross shopping. We saw a nice increase in subscriptions in Q4 with subscriptions doubling from November to December. So we're seeing some positive signs. It is still very early, but we see positive signs, and so we like what we see there.  

TOM SZKUTAK: And I will just add that Amazon Prime while very expensive, we see in it the same potential that we had with the FREE Super Saver Shipping. That was very expensive, and yet it really improved the customer experience, and we think drove very good business results over the medium-term. And that is exactly what we would expect to have happened with Amazon Prime.  

ROBERT PECK: And a quick follow-up. Could you maybe give us your thoughts on competition from eBay Express, Google Base and [Freemont] and what that could mean to your future growth?  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about other companies. But more generally what I can tell you is that we believe and have believed for a long time that the Internet is driving better and better consumer information. And as a result, we believe that companies that deliver sincerely better customer experiences, which includes competitive pricing, it includes reliable fast delivery, it includes having the right selection and the inventory in stock and available, that those important customer experience drivers will shine through in a world that has increasingly better consumer information. And I think many of the things that we see happening on the Internet fit into that trend of better and better information, more empowerment for consumers. From where we sit because of the way we have operated the business, we like that trend.  

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Credit Suisse Asset Management.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE ASSET MANAGEMENT: Can you talk just a little bit about products, your international product strategy? I know I have asked this question before, but as you continue to see success in areas outside of the -- or in areas that you don't currently offer in other markets, what is the thought process behind expanding your product portfolio internationally to mirror the one that you have got in the U.S.?  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure. We in terms of additional selection you should expect going forward that we are going to add additional selection in the categories that we are in. You should expect that we are going to launch new categories certainly over time in international as well. When we launch new categories, we are always trying to learn how to give the best possible customer experience that we can. We learn from that, and then we expand to other geographies. And so that is how we think about it traditionally. That has happened first starting with the U.S., but certainly over the past few years, we have also done that in all the geographies we are in.  

HEATH TERRY: So there are certain limitations in the international markets that have kept you from entering categories there that have been successful here?  

JEFF BEZOS: No, I would not say there are structural limitations. As we build up categories, we need to build supply chain vendor relationships and so on. So there is a deliberate effort that takes time that we go through in opening those categories. We used the data from whatever market we first opened in. We used that data to help prioritize which categories we do next in other geographies. But our selection goals -- well, first of all, in terms of category expansion, our long-term vision is to have all the geographies be the same. So any store you see in any category you see in any geography, you will see in all the geographies. So that is a long-term vision.  

And then within each category, we also continue to add selection. So even in categories -- even in U.S. books, the category that we have been working on the longest -- even in that category over this past year, we added significant selection.  

OPERATOR: Paul Keung, CIBC World Markets.  

PAUL KEUNG, ANALYST, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: With your free cash flow growth that has (inaudible) somewhat in the midteens in the back half of this year, and then based on your guidance, it looks like you are looking for free cash flow growth next year in a midpoint somewhere plus or minus 10%. So the basis of that question is I guess very similar to that of Anthony. I mean, as you plan your business out and if you look at the range of guidance for next year, is it possible to manage your business from a point your actual free cash flow may not grow next year, or do you actually manage actively to try to sustain a growth comparable to your top-line?  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, certainly we have a focus of trying to make sure that we grow free cash flow and free cash flow per share over time. It is certainly a key element that we look at, and it is certainly the most important measure.  

That being said, we're going to make sure we do the right thing for long-term investors as well. And as you look at 2006 specifically, we think that free cash flow will trend largely with operating income. And as you look at the guidance, you can see that based on the Q1 guidance that we have given and the total year guidance that we have given that we expect that the leverage is likely to be better in the second half versus the first half. So again, as you look at free cash flow, we think it will trend in line with how I described.  

PAUL KEUNG: Is that more specific to your OpEx, or is it that the capital spending that is causing that?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, if you look at the operating expense for 2005 and the buildup that we have had through the course of the year, you have seen that very specifically our total operating expenses are up 127 basis points. Our technology and content is 115 basis points of that increase. And, as Jeff described earlier, that is because of the opportunities that we see.  

We are going to still increase technology and content next year. We are going to hire more software development engineers and computer scientists. But I would not expect that the increase in technology and content in 2006 to be as great as 2005. So again, you have the base that we have that you can see as of Q4 and then the elements that I described, which would mean that as you get closer to the back half of the year, we will be lapping some of the big increases that you saw in 2005.  

PAUL KEUNG: Got it. I see. And then one real quick one. I have seen some interesting things you have done on Alexa, IMBd and on the Search, and I was curious is there any modernization of those assets in your '06 forecast?  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure, yes. Certainly the IMBd, certainly we would monetize that today. It is an interesting business for us, and certainly it is incorporated into the guidance for 2006.  

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Two questions. First of all, can you talk about just overall market-wise the UK e-commerce market? Is there any interesting nuances, challenges, changes in that market dynamic there from an economy standpoint, just maybe a slowdown as you went throughout the quarter?  

Second, can you talk about I guess the third-party business in Europe? And are you getting enough selection in broadly in the international markets to drive relevance and drive transactions, or do you think there is still opportunity to build out selection through a third-party platform there?  

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of the -- you know, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about individual countries. But if you look at certainly our international growth, we saw we had a very solid performance in our international segment in Q4. We grew revenue 13% on a dollar basis, but 23% on a local currency basis, which was consistent with what we saw in Q1. A little bit below what we saw in Q3. Excuse me, Q2 and Q3 with Q3 had Harry Potter 6 in it. But our operating performance in total was very strong with gross margins being at the highest level that they have been in some time, gross profit being up 44% and CSOI growing 89%. So strong overall operating performance in international.  

And then in terms of the third-party, it continues to be a big part of our overall mix globally in both segments. As I have mentioned in the opening comments, the third-party mix is 28% of our total units globally. That is up from 26% in Q4 2004, and we still see a lot of opportunities to add selection as a seller, as well as third-party selection.  

OPERATOR: Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: Could you talk about the investments that you are making in the digital area? What is needed to get that operation going, assuming the next few years you will have a sizable part of your media available in digital format in addition to obviously securing those titles from the content providers and having some basic technology which I assume is already available? What else do you need to do to get there, and can you give us some color on these investments you are making? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: It is a good question, but it is premature for me to talk in any detail about those initiatives. We will -- you will just have to stay tuned on what we are doing there.  

SAFA RASHTCHY: Okay. Then if I could do a follow-up on a different topic. Tom, could you talk about your expectations on return on equity? Do you expect it to continue to increase, or given the investment mode that you are in and the decrease in operating income in '06, what should we expect on ROE?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. We are not giving guidance on ROE specifically, but certainly our return on invested capital, if you will, was 32% for the year. And again we still think it is something that we utilize capital very efficiently, and we think that there is a lot of opportunity over time to improve that.  

OPERATOR: Jim Friedland, SG Cowen.  

JIM FRIEDLAND, ANALYST, SG COWEN: Can you give an update on a regulatory front if there's any visibility when you might need to select sales tax beyond the states where you have physical operations?  

TOM SZKUTAK: No, there is not a lot new there. We collect sales tax in a few states today, and we continue to work to try to help legislators come up with something that is simple.  

JIM FRIEDLAND: And in the states where you do collect sales tax, is there any kind of meaningful difference in the dynamic between the way your customers purchase versus other states, like maybe not buying as many big-ticket items, things like that?  

TOM SZKUTAK: No, in fact, it is not just the individual states. You should also need to be aware that we collect value-added tax in countries that require it and have been doing so since inception. So again, we have a lot of other data points beyond the states that we collect in.  

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, J.P. Morgan.  

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, J.P. MORGAN: Hi, Jeff and Tom. In terms of you are investing a lot of money in interesting the customer's experience, if I look at the revenue growth rate, your U.S. and international business is growing at the same rate. So two questions. In terms of international, what can you do to accelerate the growth rate because I assuming the market share is probably bigger than U.S.?  

And secondly if you look at the U.S. numbers, I know you don't report gross margin as volume, but how do you think about the market share? Because if I look at the e-commerce market as probably growing like 24, 25%, you are reporting 21% revenue growth. So do you think you are losing market share, or the growth is coming from other categories, and if so, if you see an opportunity to expand into those categories? Thank you.  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure. I will take the North America piece first. I think we have made good progress. If we look at our share, we think on a product category by product category basis, we think we are doing pretty well there. If you look at the results that we have had, our North America revenue grew 22% in 2005. That is actually an acceleration up from 400 basis points, up 400 basis points from 2004. If you just look at the history, 2005 was 22% growth; 2004 was 18; 2003, 18; 2002, 12 and 2001, 3%. So again you have seen some very nice progress over the past five years in terms of growth. And so the challenge going forward is, how do we continue -- how can we continue to accelerate that growth?  

In terms of international, we still think there is a lot of opportunity as you mentioned. We are going to, as I mentioned earlier, going to continue to expand selection in the categories we are in. We are going to expand into new categories over time. Certainly over time you should expect us also to launch new countries. Certainly we're going to invest more in pricing as well and continue to focus our resources on improving the customer experience. So those are things that we think we can do to improve our growth there and will certainly get a lot of our attention.  

OPERATOR: Mark Rowen, Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL: If I could ask two questions actually. The first if I could just follow-up on Imran's question. So when you look at the international growth in media products and also consumer electronics, they tend to be trending about the same now as North America. Would you say that as you go country by country in Germany and the UK and Japan and France, are you at similar levels of penetration in those product categories as you are in the U.S. and North America, and is that why the growth is sort of trending at the same level, or is there something specific going on internationally that is causing the growth to decelerate towards that trendline? And then I have another question if I could.  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure. I think if you look at the categories that we are in outside of the U.S., we are actually in each of the countries in less categories outside of the U.S. than inside the U.S. So it is certainly an opportunity for us to grow. Again, I think if you look at the deceleration that you just described in Q4 specifically, again if you look at our total performance, you see that the performance and certainly the revenue is strong at 23% excluding exchange, which is higher than our North America growth. But on top of that, our gross profit is up 44%. Our gross margins are up 273 basis points. Our CSOI, excluding exchange, is up 89%.  

So again, we have a strong overall performance. But we need to make sure going forward that we have a good balance between growth and profitability and driving free cash flow off our international. So that is how we are thinking about it. You said you had another follow-up question?  

MARK ROWEN: Yes, just on that one also. So would you say that you are at similar levels of market share in, say, the media products category in places like the UK and Germany as you are in the U.S.?  

JEFF BEZOS: Yes, we have not disclosed our market segment share results by country or anything. But I would certainly say there is certainly very sizable opportunities both inside the U.S. and outside the U.S. and even outside of the categories that we are in. Again, we are just in less categories today outside the U.S. than in the U.S. And so there is certainly a lot of opportunity so globally.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay. My other question is for Jeff. Jeff, you have said for a long-time that your model is more efficient than the traditional retail model because you don't have to invest in real estate, which always goes up. Instead you can invest in technology, which goes down. But if I add up all of your expenses as a percent of revenue and add in free shipping, which you sort of view as a marketing expense, I think in 2005 it was a little over 20% and in the fourth quarter a little over 19, which is 200 or 300 basis points higher than a company like Wal-Mart. So could you sort of just give us an idea why that is such a paradox? Why is it that we are not seeing more efficiency if, in fact, the model is more efficient?  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, I think one thing to keep in mind is that if we were not investing in some of these new initiatives such as digital and Web Services, our cost structure would be different today. So if we were totally optimizing our cost structure for a kind of a steady-state business, you would see a different cost structure. Other things that we talk about that you may remember are, if you look at the return on invested capital, the dynamics between our business and traditional retail are very different in large part because of the efficiency of our capital model, high inventory turns, low PP&E.  

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.  

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: A couple of things about gross profit which actually surprised me upside versus our forecast. It looks like gross profit in Europe was really strong. Was there a product mix? I think you mentioned some vendor improvement. Is that sustainable?  

And then on the other revenue growth, has the credit card growth kind of flattened out a little bit here, and can you give us any outlook on what you think for other revenues going forward?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In international we did see very positive vendor management. We did see positive from third-parties. We also saw you mentioned mix. Actually the product mix, we had EGM, which at a lower margin actually grew at a faster rate. So that actually was -- hurt gross margin, if you will.  

But then also partially offsetting the expansion that we saw was certainly lower prices to customers. So that is kind of the picture on the international side.  

On the other in North America, yes, we saw very good growth in our merchant.com business, if you will, our third-party business growth, and we have two big pieces that roll through that for North America. The other pieces are cobranded credit card. We did have a very large 2004 Q4 as we have mentioned before, and we are lapping that. So that was essentially flat. So the third-party business, our merchant.com business was very strong.  

JUSTIN POST: Great. And just a follow-up. Is the improvement in Europe sustainable, or were there some one-time buys that really helped you out in the fourth quarter?  

TOM SZKUTAK: As I talked about earlier, the challenge was -- you described it is Europe; it is actually international, which includes our Asian business as well. But the challenge with our international segment is to make sure that we have a good balance between growth and profitability. And so what you saw is certainly growth in international that was stronger, excluding exchange, than we saw in North America. But again, we had expansions in gross margins and operating margins there. So the challenge going forward is we need to make sure that that is balanced and that we get both strong growth and profitability and free cash flow there.  

TIM STONE: Thanks, Justin. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you.  

OPERATOR: Again, that does conclude today's Amazon.com fourth-quarter 2005 financial results conference. We thank you all for joining us.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com third-quarter 2005 financial results conference call. Today's call is being recorded.  

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tim Stone. Please go ahead, sir.  

   TD
TIM STONE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 '05 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.  

The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2005 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2004 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  

During this call, I will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation to these measures of comparable GAAP measures.  

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against the results for the comparable period of 2004.  

Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Tim. This was another successful quarter for Amazon.com. I'll start with comments on our financial results. The financial measure we're working to maximize over the long term is free cash flow per share. Trailing 12 months free cash flow grew 13% to $475 million. As announced in August 2005, we settled a patent lawsuit on terms including a previously unanticipated payment of $40 million in Q3 2005. Q3 2005 trailing 12 months free cash flow would have grown 22% to $515 million excluding this payment. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Free cash excludes stock-based compensation and includes cash taxes paid, which is well below our booked tax provision due to our NOLs.  

The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 438 million shares, compared with 434 million, up 1%. Stock-based awards outstanding were 24 million or 5.8% of shares outstanding, down from 27 million or 6.5% of shares outstanding. We strive to efficiently manage share count to create more cash flow per share and long-term value for owners.  

Return on invested capital was 34%. We now have $248 million of deferred tax assets, up from $12 million a year ago. For comparison, excluding tax assets and this $40 million legal settlement, ROIC would have been 44%, flat with Q3 of 2004.  

Revenue grew 27% to $1.86 billion or 28% excluding the $7 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. This was the first time in over three years that we have been negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates. We will continue to talk about our results with and without the impact of FX, as we have done since Q2 of 2002.  

Q3 2005 worldwide revenue benefited by approximately 260 basis points of year-over-year growth from Harry Potter 6 tales pre-order attachments. Excluding Harry Potter 6 plus attachments and changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue growth accelerated to 25% in Q3, up from 24% on a comparable basis in Q2 of 2005.  

Worldwide unit growth was 28%. Third-party units, representing Marketplace and Merchants@ units sold on Amazon sites, were 30% of total units, up from 28%. Third-party units as a percentage of total units were 17% just three years ago.  

Active customer accounts, representing customers who ordered in the past year, surpassed 52 million, up 19%. Media increased 20% to $1.3 billion. Electronics and other general merchandise, or EGM, increased 43% to $491 million, representing 26% of worldwide sales, up from 24%.  

And for the first time on a trailing 12 month basis, our sales were over $8 billion, 45% of which came from our International segment, and worldwide EGM sales surpassed $2.1 billion.  

Gross profit grew 30% to $463 million in Q3, and gross margin increased 62 basis points to 24.9%, primarily due to increased third-party sales and a $29 million increase in other revenue, partially offset by a greater shipping loss, driven by free shipping in Amazon Prime, our lower product prices including customer savings on Harry Potter 6 and the continued mix shift to International and EGM. Although gross margins increased this quarter, I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate that we're focused on profit dollars, not percentage margins.  

Now, I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense under FAS 123(R), which we early adopted in Q1 this year. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined were $342 million or 18.4% of sales, up 59 basis points. Fulfillment was $166 million or 8.9% of sales, down 32 basis points. We have expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2005 through efficiency gains, as well as increases in leased warehouse space. We plan to continue expanding our worldwide fulfillment capacity in order to accommodate greater selection and meet anticipated shipment volumes from ourselves as well as third parties for whom we provide the fulfillment. We expect absolute amount spent in fulfillment and fulfillment-related cost of sales to increase over time. In Q3, we opened fulfillment centers in Pennsylvania, Texas and Scotland and our new fulfillment centers in Kentucky and Japan will open to serve customers in Q4.  

Marketing was $42 million or 2.3% of sales, roughly flat as a percentage of sales year over year. Technology and content was $108 million or 5.8% of sales, up 136 basis points. We intend to continue hiring computer scientists and software engineers to invest in further innovation of customers, and we expect annual technology and content costs devoted to our sole platforms -- Search, Web Services, Digital and other initiatives -- to increase in absolute dollars throughout 2005.  

G&A a was $26 million or 1.4% of sales, down 36 basis points. In Q3 2005, we recorded a $12 million credit for actual and expected reimbursement by an insurer of certain legal costs previously incurred by us. Excluding this credit, G&A would have been $38 million or 2.1% of sales, up 28 basis points.  

Now, I will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expenses to our segments. In the North American segment, revenue grew 28% to $1.04 billion, the fastest rate of growth in over four years. Media revenue grew 21% to $684 million, including sales of Harry Potter 6 in Q3. In EGM, revenue grew 33% to $304 million, representing 29% of North America revenues, up from 28%.  

Gross profit grew 31% to $292 million, and gross margin increased 71 basis points to 28.1%, largely due to a $29 million increase in high-margin other revenues and an increase in third-party sales, partially offset by Amazon Prime, our price reductions across product categories, product mix shift and free shipping. North America segment operating income increased $9 million to $66 million, and operating margin declined 64 basis points to 6.4%. A significant majority of our technology and content costs are incurred in the US, with most of them allocated to our North America segment.  

In the International segment, revenue grew 26% to $817 million. Revenue growth was 28%, adjusting for the $9 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter.  

Media revenue grew 19% to $629 million. In EGM, revenue grew 62% to $187 million, representing 23% of International revenues, up from 18%. Gross profit grew 29% to $171 million, while gross margin increased 47 basis points to 20.9%, primarily from an increase in third-party sales, partially offset by increased free shipping, product price reductions and product mix shift.  

International segment operating income increased $17 million or 46% to $55 million, and operating margin increased 88 basis points to 6.7%. The combination of operating income in our North America and International segments is our consolidated segment operating income or CSOI. Our segment information financial statement in our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI grew 28% to $121 million. Excluding the $12 million insurance reimbursement, consolidated segment operating income would have been $109 million or 5.9% operating margin.  

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 32% to $55 million. Excluding the negative impact of the $40 million legal settlement, operating income would have increased 17% to $95 million or a 5.1% operating margin.  

Our provision for income taxes increased $18 million to $21 million in Q3, or a 42% rate for the quarter, which includes the year-to-date adjustment benefit of $4 million to reflect our current estimate of our annual effective tax rate of 50%. Our effective tax rate remains higher than the 35% statutory rate, primarily due to taxable income associated with the Q1 '05 transfer of certain operating assets from US to international locations. We expect these asset transfers to result in tax expense for financial reporting above the 35% statutory rate throughout 2005 and beneficially impact our effective tax rate over time.  

On a cash basis, since we have NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant effect on cash taxes paid in 2005. We expect cash taxes paid to be approximately $25 million in 2005, compared with $4 million in 2004. Cash taxes paid were $11 million Year to date.  

GAAP net income was $30 million or $0.07 per diluted share, compared with $54 million and $0.13 per diluted share. The $24 million decline in GAAP net income is primarily due to the $18 million increase in income taxes and $20 million after-tax impact of the litigation settlement. Excluding the legal settlement, net income would have been $50 million or $0.12 per diluted share.  

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $234 million to $1.4 billion. Since Q3 '04, we repurchased $265 million of our convertible debt.  

Inventory increased 28% to $456 million, and turns decreased 11% to 14.8, as we expanded the breadth of our product category selection in our fulfillment centers and took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors. Inventory turns have been approximately 15 each quarter this year. We will continue to increase our mix of direct buying in existing and new product categories, enabling us to offer even lower prices to customers.  

Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased 42% from a year ago to $322 million. Our capital expenditures were $76 million for Q3 and $149 million year to date. $57 million of year-to-date CapEx was software development costs.  

Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience -- convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. We continue to be pleased with the initial Amazon Prime results and have seen increased purchases by Amazon Prime customers across more categories, especially heavy purchases in electronics, tools, kitchen and health and personal care. For $79 a year, Amazon Prime members get all-you-can-eat free express shipping. Customers continue to join Amazon Prime, and we anticipate even higher enrollment rates as we get closer to the holidays.  

Amazon's Search Inside the Book program continues to expand rapidly. At this point, one out of every two books Amazon sells in the US are fully searchable. Working directly with publishers, Amazon has made it possible to search the complete interior text of hundreds of thousands of books. In addition to searching, customers can look at full interior pages that match their search criteria. Based on the success of the program in the US, we have now launched Search Inside the Book in the UK, Germany, France and Canada.  

A9.com, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, launched A9.com Maps, a new service that shows users an interactive map and over 35 million corresponding street level images in a single interface in 24 cities.  

Developers continue to adopt our Web Services tools. Over 135,000 have registered to date, upgraded in (ph) 60% year over year. One example of the flexibility and utility of Web Services is that customers can now exchange coins and bills at Coinstar centers with no transaction fee for a gift certificate instantly redeemable at Amazon.com. Coinstar implemented this using Amazon Web Services APIs. Third-party sellers remain a key part of our selection expansion. And worldwide active seller accounts, merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months, for the first time exceeded 1 million, up 29% year over year.  

Some pricing highlights include the average customer discount across books, music and video products purchased on Amazon.com increased approximately 375 basis points year over year. The average customer discount for electronics purchased on Amazon.com increased over 100 basis points year over year. Customers so far this year have saved over $300 million on shipping through our worldwide free shipping offers in Amazon Prime. And starting today, customers shopping Amazon.co.uk now qualify for free shipping on orders over 15 pounds, down from the prior threshold of 19 pounds.  

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Let me also remind everyone that we mark our euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a gain or loss for any movements in the euro between reporting dates. We also have exposure to the euro related to our interest expense on this euro-denominated debt. We incur a foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies, which are to be repaid among subsidiaries. Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a particular period. Our effective tax rate in 2005 and beyond are subject to a significant variation based on changes in our corporate structure, timing differences, current tax laws and estimates such as estimate revisions resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and our stock price. Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to stock-based compensation or our restructuring-related estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.  

For Q4, we expect net sales of between $2.86 billion and $3.16 billion, or growth of between 13 and 24%. This guidance anticipates an over $100 million negative impact from foreign exchange due to the dollar's continued strengthening. GAAP operating income to be between 135 and 210 million, or be between a 17% decline and 29% growth. This includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets of approximately $30 million, up from $20 million based on our prior stock-based compensation accounting method. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $165 million and $240 million, or between a 7% decline and 35% growth.  

For calendar year 2005, we expect net sales of between $8.373 billion and $8.673 billion, or growth of between 21 and 25%. GAAP operating income to be between $403 million and $378 million, or between a 9% decline and 8% growth. This includes $144 million for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and the $40 million legal settlement.  

In 2004, stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets was $59 million under our prior stock-based compensation accounting method. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $547 million and $622 million, or growth of between 12% and 27%. We expect 2005 free cash flow to grow year over year, and we expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development costs of approximately $200 million.  

As a reminder, we will be giving 2006 expectations when we report our Q4 results. Our financial focus is on long-term growth and free cash flow per share. We are confident that if we continue to improve the customer experience, including increase in selection and lowering prices, and execute efficiently our value propositions as well as our free cash flow will further expand.  

Thanks. And with that, Tim, let's move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Thanks, Tom. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question?  

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Doug Anmuth, Lehman Brothers.  

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Regarding Amazon Prime, earlier in the year, you changed your guidance pretty significantly for the program. I think you also said that it may be the most expensive initiative you've done since free shipping. Can you give us a better sense of really how it's doing so far? Is it actually as expensive as you originally thought?  

And then, also, regarding the $12 million credit reimbursement during the quarter, can you tell us during which quarter that actually came in to the P&L originally?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of Amazon Prime, it certainly is expensive in the short term, but we think it's certainly the right thing to do. What we are finding is certainly customers like it. They are buying more. They are also doing more cross-shopping, and as I had mentioned, it's especially heavy in certain categories, as I mentioned in the opening remarks.  

JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT, CEO, CHAIRMAN, AMAZON.COM, INC.: It's expensive, as Tom is saying, but it has a lot of benefits for customers and, long term, for Amazon and Amazon shareholders. Customers, when they start using Amazon Prime, it not only saves them money on shipping. But because, for free, as members they get expedited fast shipping, it actually changes the way they think about and use Amazon. And we have seen significant lift in Amazon Prime members. So we did say short-term investment; it is expensive in the short term. We think it's one of the most important things that we are doing over the long term.  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the $12 million credit, we had previously expensed that over several quarters. We haven't disclosed the exact amounts per quarter, but it was over several quarters.  

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: It looks like International you were affected a bit by the currency effects. But can you talk about markets like Germany, where I think a VAT was implemented and I think growth had to kind of slowed down broadly in the e-commerce world out there, how that is performing as you have kind of comped against that?  

Second, Amazon Prime looks to be, I guess, generally successful, based on kind of your commentary. I guess one of the themes that you have kind of consistently executed on is rolling out these types of services globally across the broader franchise internationally, in UK and Germany. Can you talk to the concept of have you gotten enough data and analytics behind Prime to kind of look at this on a global scale, or are we still too early, in terms of kind of having the understanding of what the impact is on frequency and usage?  

JEFF BEZOS: It is still early. However, you are right that we do like to operate consistently globally. And so, we will be trying to do that over time, but you just have to sort of stay tuned for that.  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question, we are not breaking out any of the individual countries within international. But you are right; we did get hurt a little bit by currency. International revenue was 26% on a dollar basis, 28% on a local currency basis. And then unit growth was actually faster than that. So that's just a little bit more information on that.  

JEETIL PATEL: A quick follow-up -- is there any way to leverage the 1 million sellers that you have that have grown 30% a year to create pretty much an outbound advertising or distribution model for those products, and kind of leverage that and maybe create a distribution model around those seller or merchant accounts that you have today?  

JEFF BEZOS: Those are the kinds of things that we think a lot about. And it's our practice not to talk specifically about what we might do in the future, but we do think about those kinds of things.  

OPERATOR: Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley  

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: It's actually Brian Pitz for Mary. A couple of things here -- can you talk about your add-on sales for Harry Potter involvements (ph), your expectations and maybe provide a little more detail on the geographic breakout of sales for the book? And also, on a separate note, we noticed advertisements in your Gold Box items recently. Can you talk about the impact of these ads on your margins, and any thoughts regarding advertisements in other areas of your site?  

TOM SZKUTAK: The first part of your question -- you said add-ons. I'm assuming you mean attachments to the HP 6 orders. We haven't broken that out; the only thing that we said was that the total impact on revenue, including attachments, were 260 basis points.  

Can you repeat the second part of the question again? Sorry.  

BRIAN PITZ: Just in terms of geographic breakout for sales.  

TOM SZKUTAK: We have not split out Harry Potter by geography, but directionally, you can assume that it's approximately the same as the magnitude of the segments themselves. Again, that's directional.  

BRIAN PITZ: And on the Gold Box advertisements, any thoughts for impact in areas where you could use advertisements such as that in other places on your site?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I think what you're seeing -- I would think of it as small, but certainly something that we like, but it's something that's small.  

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Tom, if I'm doing the math correctly, it looks like your trailing 12-month free cash flow is growing slower than your trailing 12-month revenue growth. I just wondered if you could comment on that. And it looks like it's before the CapEx line, so I wanted to get a perspective on that.  

And the second question is, if I back out the one-time benefit that you just mentioned, the $12 million, from the $120 million pro forma operating income line, it means you did about $109 million of pro forma operating income ex that onetime item, which implies your operating margin of about 4.9%, which is the lowest we've seen it in quite some time. And if I compare that to your guidance, you have upside relative to your expectations in revenue in guidance, but you didn't really have upside in operating income. And I'm trying to understand, is that margin and that lack of leverage due to an opportunity that you saw in the quarter that caused you to spend more money, so we could see a benefit later on in 2006? Or is that because something was more expensive than you had anticipated?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question, on our free cash flow, it's actually not before CapEx, in terms of the numbers that you gave. Our operating cash flows is actually up 35% year over year on a trailing 12-month basis, and that includes the $40 million settlement. So if you back that out, it's actually operating cash flows are growing on a trailing 12-month basis up 43%.  

Free cash flow, excluding the $40 million payment, is growing 22%. And what you're seeing is we're spending certainly more this year than last year on capital expenditures, and it's in a few different places. Certainly, as we add more computer science and software engineers and we are capitalizing parts of that development, you're seeing that included in our CapEx. Also, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we'll continue to support our growth; we're adding capacity. We added three fulfillment centers in Q3. That's reflected in the CapEx that you saw over the past 12 months and in Q3. We also are adding two new ones in Q4, one in Japan and one in the US. Some of the CapEx certainly has been spent so far in Q3 and prior as well on those. So again, what you're seeing is an increase in CapEx.  

On CSOI, as you mentioned, yes, you did the math right. If you back out the 12, it's actually 109. So it's 121 less the 12, you get to 109. So instead of our revenue growth of 27%, our CSOI growth was 28%. If you back out the 12, it's 15. And again, what you're seeing is, if you look at the operating expense, the most significant increase is technology and content, and that's an opportunity. We have been very successful in hiring, over the last several quarters, software engineers and computer scientists. We're going to continue to add more computer scientists and software engineers. Those computer scientists and software development engineers are continuing to innovate on behalf of customers. They continue to work on the seller platform, making it easier for sellers to sell. We are continuing to work on Search, on Digital and A9, and these are opportunities that we're spending those dollars on for the future growth of our business.  

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.  

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: A pretty wide range for operating income guidance in the fourth quarter. I'm wondering if you can comment at all on whether other income is difficult to forecast, and that could be part of that. Also, what your expectations are for pricing in the retail environment. We've come out with a pretty negative call at the firm on discounting in the fourth quarter. Can that change your numbers? Do you have to kind of match your competitors as the quarter progresses?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Just as it relates to Q4 in total, we're optimistic; we are cautiously optimistic about Q4. Over the past 12 months, we have added a lot of great selections. We have continued to lower prices. So we are cautiously optimistic.  

It is, however, a seasonal quarter; it's difficult to predict. From a cost standpoint, this is the first time we will have Amazon Prime in Q4. We think that's going to be great for customers, but we also think it's going to be expensive. And, since we haven't gone through a Q4 yet with Amazon Prime, it's difficult to estimate that impact. So that's really, certainly, the key drivers; but again, we are cautiously optimistic. We think the experience of our customers is going to be the best experience they've had, and we are excited about it. But again, the wide range reflects the uncertainty that it's difficult to predict.  

JEFF BEZOS: And the Amazon Prime point that Tom made is a good one because, in the holiday season, we know that people especially appreciate being able to get two-day shipments. And also, as Amazon Prime members, they can get anything shipped next day for just $3.99. So that is a very big event coming up for us.  

JUSTIN POST: A follow-up, if I may. On the other income, it showed nice year-over-year growth. Can you provide any detail on whether that was related to the credit card referrals or whether it was merchant.com? What grew faster in the quarter?  

TOM SZKUTAK: It was both. Those are the two principal pieces, the majority of other revenue.  

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, JPMorgan.  

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Two questions. First, I was wondering if you can comment on how much increased oil prices impact your gross margin. And secondly, if I look at international revenue, even if we look at it on the constant currency, the growth rate is 28%. It sounds like growth is decelerating pretty quickly from last year. I was wondering, what are you doing to maybe stabilize the growth rate in the international markets?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I'll take international growth one first. International growth on a dollar basis was 26%, as you mentioned. Excluding FX, it was 28%. Unit growth is higher than that. Unit growth did not decelerate from the past few quarters.  

In terms of oil prices, our fulfillment and operations team continually work on trying to figure out ways to offset those costs. And we haven't quantified that externally, but certainly we're continually looking at ways to offset that cost in each of the quarters. And you can see the expansion that we had of 62 basis points in gross margins, and that's reflected in those gross margins during the quarter.  

OPERATOR: Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: Can you talk about the level of spending you have in content and technology? I understand you're focus and your success, as you have said, in hiring computer scientists and software engineers, but both the absolute as well as the percentage of content and development as a percentage of revenue has increased. And if I'm not mistaken, it's the highest you have had since Q3 of 2002, at about 5.8%. Can you tell us some concept of how many engineers you have? How many more do you think you need? Should we expect this kind of trajectory of increase as a percentage of sales to continue next year and beyond?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Just to take the latter part of the question first, we're not giving guidance on 2006. You should expect, on a dollar basis, the technology and content is going to continue to grow. And, as I mentioned, you are right; it is at a high level from where we have been previously. It is 5.8% of revenue. And again, some of the things I talked about earlier -- we're going to continue to further innovate on behalf of customers. We're going to continue to work on the platform, sell the platform, continue to work on Search, Web Services, Digital. Certainly, productivity within our operations is driven by technology, as well. So, again, those are things we think are important in the short and long term for our customers.  

JEFF BEZOS: And just to add to that, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity and innovation yet to come, and we and our software engineering community are the ones who, in large part, help us unlock that innovation and opportunity. So things like Search Inside the Book, the fact that one of every two books that we sell here in the US now is -- the complete interior text of those books is searchable. Those kinds of initiatives are expensive. They require investments for many of those kinds of initiatives do not pay back in the initial period where you make the investment, but they are the right thing to do for the medium term in the business.  

SAFA RASHTCHY: I understand, but if I may follow up, you have always been focused on those new initiatives for customers, as well as for third-party merchants. But the rate of spending as a percentage has been accelerating significantly. Are you seeing new opportunities, or are there other areas that you need to spend this additional money on?  

JEFF BEZOS: The answer is we are seeing new opportunities. And we see it in some of the classic parts of our business, where we are able to do things like Amazon Prime, fast-track shipping, so that we can increase selection, have the stuff in stock and, at low cost, get it to you in two days if you are an Amazon Prime member.  

And also, in completely new areas of our business like Amazon Web Services, which we are opening up the insides of Amazon.com and making those available to developers all over the world. And that's a business that's growing very rapidly for us and something we're going to continue to focus on.  

And then our Digital efforts, which we think are a very large opportunity for a company like Amazon that has a big media business. So some of those things you are not able to see and inspect yet, but we are working very hard on them.  

OPERATOR: Bob Peck, Bear Stearns.  

BOB PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Congratulations on a good quarter. I just want to ask a couple quick questions here. The first is, could you touch quickly on your EFT effort there and what that could end up doing to fulfillment as a percent of revenues going forward?  

Number two, could you touch quickly on IPXL and what is going on there with the one-click patent?  

And lastly, Jeff, touching on what you just said, could you talk a little bit more about the digital media downloads, when we think we could see something like that, and how that could play as far as a DVD rental business for the Company?  

TIM STONE: Bob, this is Tim. Could you clarify your first question, on EFT?  

BOB PECK: The electronic funds transfer stuff -- we have sort of been hearing you have been playing around with that to a degree; you have customers pay directly from bank accounts. And we know that the credit card portion is one of the large impacts of the fulfillment cost, as far as a percent of revs. And we are sort of wondering what traction you have gotten there, what progress you have gotten and where you sort of see that going, where it could take fulfillment as a percent of revs going forward?  

TOM SZKUTAK: It's very early. We have just launched EFT, as you're describing it, on Amazon.com. You'll probably recall that we launched something similar in Germany several years ago, so we do have some experience in this area.  

In terms of -- could you repeat the other parts of your question? I apologize.  

BOB PECK: The second question was on the IPXL lawsuit with the one-click patent and where that stands, and the last part was on the digital media downloads and sort of a timeframe on that, maybe margins associated with it, and the sort of time of any sort of DVD rental program.  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the legal question, I don't think it's -- we have a long-standing practice of not commenting on litigation. So I'm not going to comment here, as well. On Digital --  

JEFF BEZOS: On Digital, it's too early to give you any details, any specific details. But it is something that we're putting a lot of energy into with a talented team of folks, and we think we have some good offerings that we can bring to our customers over time. And I think there was one other piece of the question, but I forgot it.  

BOB PECK: It was the margins and any sort of tie-in with the DVD rental business.  

JEFF BEZOS: DVD rental is going very well in Germany and the UK. With respect to launching that in other countries, it's not something that we're prepared to talk about.  

OPERATOR: Scott Devitt, Legg Mason.  

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, LEGG MASON: I had a question around A9 -- just interested if you could update us on how you are progressing with the strategy there, and maybe some specific data points or metrics around the pi discount and the loyalty that you have wrapped around that in that marketplace. And also, longer-term, if A9 something that is going to continue to grow organically, or you think there will be either technology or other acquisitions in that area?  

JEFF BEZOS: The A9, for those of you who don't know, has two things. The team works on Amazon product search and also the product search that we give to our merchant.com partners. And also, they have a consumer-facing website at A9.com that licenses Google Web search results and then adds some of the customer-centric things that Amazon has done over time. So it says things like people who visit this website also visit these websites. It stores your history on the server side. To use the A9 toolbar, you can keep track of the history of the sites you've visited. Based on that history, it will make recommendations to you of other sites to visit, things like that. And that team continues to innovate. Their goal is to build an enhanced Web search service, and we think there are going to be many winners of different magnitudes and different niches in that space.  

BOB PECK: Anything around the pi divided by 2 discount that you offer, and if that has added any loyalty or traffic to A9? I think there has to be a --  

JEFF BEZOS: Yes, we're not providing any statistics or metrics on any of those A9 characteristics at this time.  

OPERATOR: Mark Rowen, Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL: A couple of questions. First, when I look at your operating margin internationally, it's higher than the US, despite the fact that gross margins are 700 basis points lower. And I know you said that you put a lot of your technology development expense on the US business, but I was wondering if you could just help me understand why there is such a huge disparity in operating profit, despite -- or in gross profit, but that's not showing up in operating profit, in those two businesses.  

And then, secondly, I know you don't give out a lot of information on your third-party business. But the 30% of units that is third-party -- I was wondering if you could give us a sense, at least directionally, of how much of that is outside of your media products?  

TOM SZKUTAK: If I understand your question correctly, in terms of the gross margin difference between International and North America, there are a few principal pieces. One is both North America and International third-party growth continues to grow nicely, and we're pleased with what we see there. But certainly, our third-party business is larger in North America than it is in International. So that's certainly one of the key differences. One of the other differences is it's still very early globally on our purchasing or vendor management initiatives. But we are further ahead, certainly, in North America than we are in International. So it's an opportunity for us, and we certainly expect to capitalize going forward on that.  

In terms of what's falling through in operating profit, I think you have it characterized right. Certainly, the bulk of the technology and content costs are certainly expended in the US and are allocated to the North America segment. You're certainly seeing the significant portion of the G&A and/or legal-related costs hitting the North America segment as well. So those are some of the few differences.  

MARK ROWEN: And the percentage of your third-party business that is done in media versus other -- is that similar to your revenue mix, or it's about 70/30?  

TOM SZKUTAK: We haven't broken that out. We do have, certainly have third parties in both EGM and media, in both segments.  

JEFF BEZOS: It's a meaningful part of both businesses.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Correct. And again, they are continuing to grow in both segments.  

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citigroup.  

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: You talked about the impact of Harry Potter on the top line. Could you at all comment on how much of an impact it would have had on the margins? And then a quick follow-up to Mark's question on the third-party sales, particularly internationally. Can you just talk directionally about how much lower the third-party penetration in total unit sales would likely be internationally than in the US? And any particularly interesting trends or any inflection point trends in terms of when that could gap up or reach up to US levels?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the margin impact of Harry Potter 6, it was essentially a contribution profit breakeven event for us globally. In terms of third party, we haven't given any splits for the individual segments as to where we are there. But what we have said, again, is both segments continue to grow nicely. We are pleased with the performance overall, and we will continue to invest to make it easier for sellers to sell. And certainly North America is further along than International, and that's an opportunity for us.  

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Credit Suisse First Boston.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about your plans for -- or what you're seeing in terms of marketing. As sponsored search and, obviously, comparative shopping becomes more meaningful, how is that playing a role? Obviously, marketing expense has been incredibly consistent over the course of this year. Do you see that changing much as we go into Q4?  

JEFF BEZOS: I would just say that most of our marketing expense is very measurable. And, as a result, we are able to -- it's susceptible to analysis. We are able to spend the right amount of money marketing these categories. So if you could meaningfully spend more and have it be contribution profit positive to do so, then you can sort of do that when it's measurable. And otherwise, you can back away from it. We also have other programs like the associates program and other kinds of marketing methods besides the sort of sponsored links.  

And the other thing, of course, that we do -- even though it doesn't show up in the marketing line -- is we consider some of the investments we make in things like Amazon Prime, some of the investments we make in things like Super Saver Shipping, to be a marketing expense. Our best first avenue is to figure out meaningful ways to give the money to customers rather than to advertising venues and then, by providing that good experience, have customers have a deeper percentage of their wallet share with us.  

OPERATOR: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session today. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.  

TIM STONE: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for the questions. A replay will be available, as is typically the case, on our investor relations website at least until the end of the quarter. And we appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.  

JEFF BEZOS: Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you.  

OPERATOR: This does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com second-quarter 2005 financial results teleconference. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tim Stone. Please go ahead, sir.  

TIM STONE, VP, IR, AMAZON.COM: Hello and welcome to our Q2 '05 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.  

   TD
The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2005 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2004 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  

Finally, unless otherwise stated all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2004.  

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM: Thanks, Tim. This was another successful quarter for Amazon.com. I will start with comments on our financial results. Our ultimate financial measure and the one we most want to optimize over the long-term is free cash flow per share. Trailing 12 months or TTM free cash flow grew 37% to $486 million driven by improvements in operating profit. As a reminder, free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.  

Free cash flow excludes stock-based compensation and includes cash taxes paid, which is well below our booked tax provision due to our NOLs. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 438 million shares compared with 434 million, a 1% increase. Stock-based awards outstanding were 26 million or 6.3% of shares outstanding, down from 27 million or 6.7% of shares outstanding. We strive to efficiently manage share count to create more cash flow per share and long-term value for owners.  

Return on invested capital was 37%, down from 39%. We calculate ROIC as trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. We now have $269 million of tax assets, up from $7 million a year ago. For comparison ROIC would have been 44% excluding deferred tax assets.  

Revenue grew 26% to $1.75 billion or 25% excluding the $25 million benefit from the year-over-year changes in FX. Worldwide unit growth of 27%. Third-party units as a percentage of total units were 28%, up from 24%. Active customer accounts representing customers who have ordered in the past year have now surpassed 50 million, up 19%.  

Electronics and other general merchandise or EGM increased to 26% of worldwide sales in Q2 of '05, up from 23%. And on a trailing 12 month basis, we exceeded 7.6 million in sales. 45% came from our international segment, up from 42%.  

Gross profit grew 32% to $450 million in Q2, and gross margin increased 110 basis points to 25.7% primarily due to increased third-party sales and a $26 million increase in other revenue, partially offset by an $11 million greater shipping loss driven by free shipping at Amazon Prime, our lower product prices and the continued mix shift to international and EGM.  

Although gross margins increased this quarter, I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate that we are focused on profit dollars not percentage margin.  

Before we move to the operating expense line items, a quick reminder about stock-based compensation. In Q1 we began classifying stock-based compensation within the fulfillment, marketing, techno content and G&A line items as we do for cash compensation. In our earnings release we have included a reconciliation of these line items from what we reported to an amount net of stock-based compensation.  

Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense as we have in the past. Fulfillment, marketing, techno content and G&A combined was $318 million or 18.2% of sales, up 85 basis points. Fulfillment was $153 million or 8.7% of sales, down 13 basis points. We expanded our fulfillment capacity in 2004 and the first half of 2005 through efficiency gains, as well as increases in leased warehouse space. We plan to continue expanding our worldwide fulfillment capacity in order to meet the anticipated shipment volumes from our sales, as well as sales by third parties for whom we provide the fulfillment.  

In Q2 we opened three non-sortable fulfillment centers which are unautomated and lower capital in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Arizona. We plan to open more fulfillment centers worldwide this year including new facilities in Dallas, Japan and Scotland.  

Marketing was $40 million or 2.3% of sales, flat year-over-year. Technology and content was $93 million or 5.3% of sales, up 110 basis points. We intend to continue hiring computer scientists and software engineers throughout 2005 to invest in further innovation for customers, and we expect annual technology and content costs devoted to our seller platforms, search, Web services, digital and other initiatives to increase in absolute dollars in 2005.  

G&A was $32 million or 1.8% of sales, down 12 basis points. In Q1 2005 we recorded a charge of $8 million related to possible settlements of outstanding litigation, and in Q2 2005 the favorable resolution of one of our previously outstanding legal matters resulted in a $3 million expense reduction.  

Now I will talk about our segment results. Consistent with prior periods, we don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expense to our segments. In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $960 million. The last three quarters are the three fastest growth rate quarters in four years. Media revenue grew 17% to $632 million, and the last three quarters are also the three fastest growth quarters in four years.  

In EGM revenue grew 23% to $277 million. Gross profit grew 27% to $278 million, and gross margin increased 125 basis points to 29% due to a $26 million increase in high-margin other revenues and an increase in third-party sales. This was offset by the impact on ship margins of Amazon Prime, our price reductions across product categories, product mix shift and free shipping.  

North America segment operating income increased $6 million to $72 million, and operating margin declined from 8.3% to 7.5%. As a reminder, a significant majority of our technology and content costs are incurred in the U.S. with most of them being allocated to our North America segment.  

In the international segment, revenue grew 33% to $793 million. Revenue growth was 29% adjusted for the $23 million year-over-year benefit from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 24% to $614 million, and EGM revenue grew 80% to $178 million representing 22% of total segment revenues, up from 17%. Gross profit grew 42% to $172 million, while gross margin increased 130 basis points to 21.7% primarily from third-party sales partially offset by increased free shipping, product price reductions and mix shift.  

International segment operating income increased $25 million or 72% to $60 million, and operating margin increased 173 basis points to 7.6%. The combination of operating income in our North American and international segments is our consolidated segment operating income or CSOI. Our segment information financial statement and our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income. CSOI grew 31% to $132 million or 29% excluding $2 million favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating margin increased 25 basis points to 7.5%.  

Unlike CSOI our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased 21% to $104 million, and GAAP operating margin decreased 26 basis points to 6.0% (ph).  

Excluding the $5 million impact from our early adoption of FAS 123 on January 1st, 2005, operating income would have grown 27% to $110 million.  

Our provision for income taxes increased $51 million to $56 million in Q2, a 52% effective tax rate higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to taxable income associated with the Q1 transfer of certain operating assets from the U.S. to international locations. As we said last quarter, we expect these asset transfers to result in tax expense for financial reporting above the 35% statutory rate throughout 2005 and beneficially impact our effective tax rate over time.  

On a cash basis, since we have NOLs, these asset transfers will not have a significant effect on cash taxes paid in 2005. We expect cash taxes paid to be approximately $25 million in 2005 compared with $4 million in 2004. Cash taxes paid were $5 million for the first half of 2005.  

While we are not endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a financial reporting basis, we have said we endeavor to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis.  

GAAP net income was $52 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared with $76 million and $0.18 per diluted share. The $24 million decline in GAAP net income is primarily due to the $51 million increase in income taxes. GAAP net income includes a $9 million benefit from foreign exchange.  

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $174 million to $1.32 billion. Since Q2 '04, we repurchased $265 million of our convertible debt. Inventory increased 35% to $383 million, and turns decreased 14% to 15.3 as we bolstered inventory to optimize in stock levels across product categories, expanded the breadth of product category selection in our fulfillment centers and took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors. For the last three quarters, our inventory turns have been over 15.  

We will continue to increase our mix of direct buying and existing and new product categories, enabling us to offer even lower prices to customers. Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased 24% from a year ago to $267 million. Our capital expenditures were $46 million for Q2 and $73 million year-to-date, slightly less than half of year-to-date CapEx with software development costs.  

Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary input of customer experience, convenience, selection and price. Some recent examples of our progress include Amazon Prime. We're pleased with initial Amazon Prime results and have seen increased shopping across more categories by Amazon Prime customers. We are continuing to see especially heavy use of Amazon Prime in electronics, tools, kitchen and health and personal care. For $79 a year, Amazon Prime members get all-you-can-eat free express shipping. Amazon Prime members love getting unlimited two day shipping for free with no minimum order size. Though expensive for the Company, Amazon Prime feeds the premium experience for customers who join, and as a result, we will hope they purchase more from us in the long-term.  

Harry Potter 6. We received more than 1.5 million preorders for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth book in the series. On Amazon.com we offered U.S. customers guaranteed delivery of the book on its release date, Saturday, July 16, 2005 with same price as standard shipping. And this service was free for Amazon Prime members. We shipped Harry Potter 6 to over 165 countries from Algeria to Zimbabwe. We're pleased we were able to provide Harry Potter 6 to customers at such an attractive price worldwide. At roughly our overall cost, it was essentially a contribution profit breakeven event for us.  

Amazon's digital team recently launched "Search Inside the Book" in the UK and Germany, enabling international customers to find and discover books by searching and previewing the text inside. Customers can now preview the text inside hundreds of thousands of books.  

Developers continue to adopt our Web services tools. Over 120,000 have registered to date, up greater than 70% year-over-year. Customers continue to enjoy our content, which includes millions of customer reviews. Customer reviews increased by over 1 million year-over-year.  

In July we acquired CustomFlix, an on-demand video DVD publishing company. CustomFlix's disc-on-demand production enables economically efficient distribution for lower volume product and will enable previously unavailable films and programming to be made available to our customers. This combined with our April acquisition of BookSurge allows customers new on-demand flexibility in both print and DVD.  

We launched DVD Rental in Germany with subscription plans starting at just EUR9.99 per month. Customers also receive an additional 5% off Amazon's already low prices under DVD purchases from Amazon.de.  

Third-party sellers remain a key part of our selection expansion; and active seller accounts, merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months, exceeded 975,000, up 32% year-over-year.  

Some pricing highlights include the average customer discount across books, music and video products purchased on Amazon.com increased over 200 basis points year-over-year. The average customer discount for electronics on Amazon.com increased over 200 basis points year-over-year. In Japan we lowered DVD pricing on certain major titles from 20% to 22% off list. And customers so far this year have saved over $200 million on shipping through our "Free Shipping" offers in Amazon Prime.  

Additionally Amazon Services has expanded its Merchant.com enterprise partners to include Sears.ca. Amazon Services will build a new Sears Canada branded website using Amazon technology and provides Sears Canada with tools and services to be in control of its brand, merchandising and online business.  

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our Q3 '05 guidance and 2005 baseline expectations are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in the Euro, Pound, Yen, Canadian dollar and Yuan exchange rates, and as well as the global economy and consumer spending, and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Let me also remind everyone that we mark our Euro denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter which results in a gain or loss for any movement in the Euro between the reporting dates. We also have exposure to the Euro related to our interest expense on this Euro denominated debt. We incur a financial currency gain or loss corresponding with the intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies which have to be repaid among subsidiaries.  

Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a particular period.  

Our effective tax rate in 2005 and beyond is subject to significant variations based on our corporate structure, timing differences and current tax laws. Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangible assets or any future revisions to our restructuring-related estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.  

Accordingly, for the last few years, we have discussed the results with and without the impact of foreign exchange rates. For Q3 we expect net sales of between 1.76 billion and 1.91 billion or growth of between 20 and 31%. GAAP operating income to be between $60 million and $90 million or between -26% and 11% growth. This includes stock-based compensation of approximately $35 million, up from $9 million based on the prior accounting method. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating income, to be between $95 and $125 million or between flat and 32% growth.  

As a reminder, Harry Potter 6 will be reflected in our Q3 results.  

For the calendar year 2005, we expect net sales of between $8.275 billion and $8.675 billion, a growth of between 20 and 25%. GAAP operating income to be between $415 and $515 million or between a 6% decline and 17% growth. This includes stock-based compensation of approximately $110 million.  

In 2004 our stock-based compensation under our prior accounting method and other operating income combined was $50 million. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating income, to be between $525 and $625 million, a growth of between 7 and 28%, and we expect free cash flow to grow year-over-year with capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, of approximately $200 million.  

With the dollar's recent strengthening, for the first time in three years our guidance reflects an anticipated negative impact from foreign exchange. Since we gave our guidance in April, our estimate of the impact that foreign exchange would have on our 2005 revenue changed by over $150 million. However, because of the underlying expense of our business, we were able to raise the bottom end and maintain the top end of our revenue guidance range. In other words, if FX rates had not changed, we would have been able to raise our revenue guidance by over $150 million.  

Finally, we will be giving 2006 guidance when we report our fourth-quarter results.  

Our financial focus is on long-term growth and free cash flow per share. We are confident that if we continue to improve the customer experience, including increasing selection and lowering prices, and execute efficiently, our value proposition, as well as our free cash flow, will further expand.  

Thanks. And with that, Tim, let's move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question?  

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Scott Devitt, Legg Mason.  

SCOTT DEVITT, ANALYST, LEGG MASON: Thanks a lot. It looked like on the domestic business the other line, Merchant.com and the credit card structure from Chase, actually provided a lot of upside, and I'm wondering ultimately what the driver is there? We have noticed a lot of promotions and discountings occurring from your branded merchants within the site, and I just would like to get a little bit color around the upside in that component of the business?  

And then separately, I may have missed it, but what the third-party unit percentage was as a percentage of total units. Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER & CEO, AMAZON.COM: I think the upside on the Merchant business is being driven in large part by, if you are thinking about Merchant@, the kind of promotions that you're seeing on the website and so on, that piece of the business is being driven by selection and by increasing ease-of-use as we make it easier for customers to use merchants and buy from them just as easily as they can buy from Amazon.com.  

TOM SZKUTAK: And then on the number that you missed, it was 28% of third-party units as a percentage of total units worldwide, up from 24% last year.  

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank.  

HERMAN LEON, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: This is Herman Leon calling in for Jeetil Patel. I was just wondering how actually Amazon Prime membership has actually scaled over the past quarter and what the drivers of that were?  

TOM SZKUTAK: You know the only thing we've said so far is we are certainly pleased with the results. Customers, Prime members are doing more cross shopping and they are buying more.  

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: The first question is on incremental operating margins. The quarter had a strong acceleration in year to year and revenue growth and a nice improvement in incremental operating margins relative to the deteriorating trend in the past. As I look to your guidance, I see that the incremental operating margin is forecasted to go back into the low single digits.  

I'm just wondering should we really think about Q2 and Q3 in aggregate because of the timing differences between Q2 benefiting from a lot of traffic of people coming to Amazon.com to order Harry Potter, preorder, and potentially buying other things creating some efficiency there for you and then paying for the cost obviously gross (ph) or contribution profit neutral in Q3? That is the first question.  

The second question is, the other North American revenue line of about $50 million, how much visibility do you have into that line, and if you could break it out for us with some examples in terms of what is the largest contribution. It is obviously something we cannot forecast based on macro factors, and I just want to get a better sense for it. Is that really core to your business, or could it have big fluctuation swings since it is such a big driver of operating income profit?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of the first part of your question, I'm not sure it is appropriate to combine second and third quarter. I would say that you should look at all of our financial results over a trend over time, but I would not certainly combine something because of -- a reason to combine second and third specifically.  

In terms of your other question on other revenue, certainly in terms of the other revenue, the two most significant pieces as you mentioned were certainly Merchant.com. I think we've got some pretty good visibility around Merchant.com and the revenue generated from there. The co-branded credit card certainly is a little more difficult to forecast.  

The only element that I would say that certainly as it relates to Q -- going back to the first part of your question on Q2 and Q3, we certainly saw with some of the traffic with Harry Potter 6, we think the impact of that on Q2 revenue growth was less than 100 basis points. So from that standpoint, there is some benefit there from certainly the attachments that you see with Harry Potter 6. But that is the only case that I can see of combining them.  

OPERATOR: Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley.  

MARY MEEKER, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: You talked about Amazon Prime. Obviously there was a question on it. You have not quantified very many things about Amazon Prime. I just wanted to try to drill down on it a little bit. Most surveys show that the number one reason people don't - or drop their baskets when they are checking out online is that shipping costs are too high. You have clearly knocked that issue off with the Prime subscribers.  

But could you give us a sense of some of the user dynamics? You talked about electronics being a bigger category for the Prime users. But do you have a sense of what the lifetime value might be for those customers? Do you have a sense of the profitability of those customers? Are they -- when they are cross shopping, are they buying higher-priced items, lower-priced items?  

And do you think you are creating a brand in and of itself with Amazon Prime, for example, when people shop at the price comparison shops or sites, will they be at a point where they can think I will save on shipping because I'm a Prime customer?  

So any incremental stuff you could give us on Prime would be great, or I will just keep asking questions.  

JEFF BEZOS: I can give you a little color on that. Amazon Prime, first of all, with regard to taking the shipping costs off the table, we do that for people who are not Amazon Prime members too with FREE Super Saver Shipping. Now with FREE Super Saver Shipping the order size has to be $25, so what we're really trying to do -- and there's an additional three to five day delay in the shipment, which is what makes it affordable for us to be able to do that with standard shipping.  

Now what we are doing with Amazon Prime is a little bit different. So for $79 a year this is helping for the convenience motivated customer. So they are getting two day shipping, which is normally a very expensive shipping option; they are getting their products very very rapidly, and they don't have the mental overhead of trying to keep track of that $25 order minimum for Super Saver Shipping. So you're getting things fast.  

Now people do sign up for Amazon Prime in part to save money for sure because they do get free shipping and they get the simplicity of that. But once they have signed up and they start to use it, it changes the way they think about Amazon because they start to get things so quickly. And, of course, even for Amazon Prime members, the next day shipping, and you can order right up until 6:30 PM for -- Amazon Prime members can order right up until 6:30 PM and still get items the next day for only $3.99. So $3.99 is the same as our standard shipping price, but you're getting it tomorrow and you can order pretty late.  

So it is really about making the shopping experience simpler and improving the availability for customers so that they get stuff fast. And, of course, that $79 annual membership fee covers an entire household. So for people who have a couple of Amazon shoppers at home, it is also an unbelievably good deal, which does make it expensive for the Company in the short-term, but we believe that that will generate long-term returns for shareholders as customers change their shopping habits while they are at Amazon.  

MARY MEEKER: But just to -- got you on those points -- but what are the top three things you think shareholders will see from the Prime customer base two to three years down the road, i.e. what percentage of users are Prime customers? Has the basket size increased a lot? Has the revenue per user increased a lot? How should we think about it?  

JEFF BEZOS: Those are good questions. I don't want to speculate on some of them. I do think it is fair to speculate that we should see higher baskets -- not basket sizes, higher share of wallet from those customers shopping in more categories, that kind of thing.  

OPERATOR: Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: Good afternoon. Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about how third-party sales were increasing this quarter? I think, Jeff, you mentioned because of the selection and convenience, which as far as I know, that has been the value proposition you have had for quite some time. But your comments noted that there was an acceleration which caused the margin to be favorable. Could you comment on that as to what degree you believe that is sustainable going forward and how we should look at margin structure going forward?  

And also going back to the Prime question, it would really help us a lot -- I understand you don't want to give any numbers -- but please qualitatively if you could give us a sense of to what degree Prime contributed to this quarter's growth. At least, was it significant or insignificant?  

JEFF BEZOS: On the Prime question, we're very pleased with these results. But we don't want to give any color on the kind of thing that you're asking about at this point. And the other question for Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK: On the third-party units that we mentioned, we did see certainly a nice increase as a percentage of total units this year versus last year, and you have seen really over the last several quarters a nice pattern there. It is difficult to say what is going to happen going forward with that. Except that as Jeff mentioned earlier, we have made it easier for sellers to sell. We have made it -- that experience better for our customers, whether it is a third-party unit or an Amazon unit. So again those are a combination of things that I think are certainly helping us there, and it is difficult to say what is going to happen going forward.  

In terms of going forward, we are certainly not giving guidance on margins going forward, but certainly as you go into Q3, for example, you have seen reflected in our guidance, remember, that Harry Potter 6 for us -- as I mentioned in some of the opening comments -- is essentially a breakeven event for us from a contribution profit standpoint, which means that margins on that will be lower than average. It will bring our margins down. And so again it is difficult to say going forward beyond that from a margin expectation standpoint what will happen as a result of third-party.  

But again, we're striving to make that customer experience as good as we possibly can whether it is a -- for all customers, whether it is Amazon owned or a third-party unit.  

JEFF BEZOS: I would just add that while Tom is right that that we cannot forecast the future on that with any precision, long-term we would hope to continue to see a lot of success there, and we are investing very heavily in all parts of our third-party business. So we're investing heavily in the part of the third-party business where sellers sell on the Amazon site, and we are investing heavily in the Merchant.com business where we private-label basically do the plumbing for other people's websites.  

A lot of what you see in our tech and content expense line, and you can see in that line how we continue to increase our investment in technology. And a lot of that investment is going to make things better for our sellers and better for our buyers who are buying from our sellers. And there is a tremendous amount that can be done there over the next coming years. It is the kind of thing that I think there will be as much change and as much opportunity for growth and free cash flow generation over the next 10 years with this kind of technology innovation as there has been over the last 10 years.  

OPERATOR: Mark Rowen, Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL: Tom, you had mentioned that you got about 100 basis points of growth from Harry Potter or Harry Potter tie-ins. Was that on total revenue? So was that like $14, $15 million on the year ago number, 1% of that?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I said it was less than 100 basis points.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay. Less than 100. So approximately in that range based on total revenue. Is that right?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, less than the 14 to 15 that you described.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay. And so would you say that your tie rate was about 50%, meaning that for every dollar of Harry Potter you got, you got something like 50% sales from those same people on something else? Is that what you were saying with that?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm not -- no, I'm not following.  

MARK ROWEN: In other words, the people who ordered Harry Potter, I mean it sounds like that 13 of 14 million is about half of what you would have taken in from the Harry Potter preorders, which -- I don't know; 1.5 million times maybe $20 is $30 million. So are you saying that about half of the people also ordered something else or approximately something like that?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I don't think you can conclude that from what I said. Here is the way I would think about it -- this may help you -- but in Q2 we think the impact is less than 100 basis points. We think Q3 that it is less than 300 basis points, and that is reflected in the guidance that we gave, and again that is in terms of basis points on growth rate year-over-year.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay. And the 300 basis points are primarily from people buying other things besides Harry Potter or from buying Harry Potter?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Less than 300 basis points is primarily due to Harry Potter 6 sales, so that is included in that number.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay. And do you expect since most of the people preordered, do you expect that a lot of people will come to the site, order Harry Potter in the third quarter that did not preorder and also buy other things with it? Or is Harry Potter pretty much a preorder event for you?  

TOM SZKUTAK: No, again we have a significant number of preorders. As with any other release, you would expect to see continued sales of Harry Potter, you know, as you go through the quarters and subsequent quarters.  

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, CS First Boston.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CS FIRST BOSTON: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit -- well, first one, kind of housekeeping questions. If you could talk a little bit about your expectations for tax rate in the second half of the year and what is driving that?  

And then also if you could talk about the strategy for category expansion in Europe? Is partnering with a large third-party there still something that you might be targeting, like your Target relationship here, or do you intend to or prefer to do it all first party?  

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of your first question on tax rates, we had a 52% tax rate in Q1, a 52% effective tax rate in Q2. We're not giving guidance on effective tax rate. We have said, as it relates to cash taxes, that we said it would be approximately $25 million for the year, and so that is all we're saying on taxes.  

In terms of category expansion, you know I think again as it relates to international, we're going to continue to expand existing categories that we have. We're going to continue to expand into new categories. Certainly we have a number of third-parties that sell within our international segment today, and certainly there is the opportunity over time to have branded third-party merchants sell on our site, as well as there is certainly an opportunity to power other partners' websites over time in international as well. So I don't know if that answers your question or not.  

HEATH TERRY: Yes, that covers it. Thanks.  

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, J.P. Morgan.  

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, J.P. MORGAN: A couple of questions. Going back to this other revenue, kind of Anthony's questions, what percentage of that other revenue is critical business, and can you give us a sense like what kind of operating profit margins do you have on that other revenue?  

And then the last question is, could you give us an update on your digital media initiative in terms of DVD rental, or are you planning to get into the music business? Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of other revenue, there is a few pieces. Again, the two most significant pieces are Merchant.com business that is in that line. Another big piece is certainly our cobranded credit card, and again they are both meaningful pieces of the revenue.  

Beyond that, I think that is it on that one. In terms of digital, can you repeat --?  

IMRAN KHAN: The second question is, what is the operating margins on that other revenue segment? And the third question was, give us an update on the digital media? Like you're getting into the DVD rental business in Europe. Any plans to get into the U.S. business, or are you thinking about the music business?  

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of the margin question, we don't break out any of the margins except for the segments that we provide. So we don't break it out on any particular categories or line items.  

DVD rental we have launched in the UK, and then in this quarter we launched in Germany as well. Both of those businesses are going extremely well. As far as what we might do in the future in that regard or with music, we have a practice of not preannouncing things, and we will stick with that; so you will just have to stay tuned.  

OPERATOR: Paul Keung, CIBC World Markets.  

PAUL KEUNG, ANALYST, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: A couple of questions. I think first, not to beat the bush on Harry Potter launch, but there are some leading questions here, somewhat misleading questions I should say. I was wondering if you are seeing a similar halo effect on Harry Potter as the customer (inaudible) to relatively earlier Harry Potter book launches?  

And remind us again sort of what type of benefits you will see in Harry Potter results and whether it is preorder and post-order, typically as you launched a book, and then another question on that?  

JEFF BEZOS: Again, it is difficult to say. As I mentioned before, we think the impact on Q2 growth is less than 100 basis points. We think the impact on Q3 will be less than 300 basis points. It is difficult to compare it to other releases at this stage of where we are.  

PAUL KEUNG: But then again, it does not necessarily accrete (inaudible). For you it's more the lifetime value of the customer. And what percent of those customers buying Harry Potter now are new customers versus old; and how does that compare versus, let's say, book two, book three, book four?  

JEFF BEZOS: We don't break that out, but I will tell you that anecdotally we love the opportunity to reach out and interact with customers of that age group. Those are customers that we hope and expect to be, if we give them a good experience now, we hope and expect that they will be customers of ours for many decades to come.  

And this is a fantastic opportunity for us to show off our very best for both kids and parents. And the team here works incredibly hard on it. The logistical exercise involved in laying down over a million copies of Harry Potter on a single day is truly phenomenal, and there is just a lot of work that goes into it, and it also happens to be a very fun exercise, especially when it is over.  

PAUL KEUNG: Okay. And then you mentioned earlier about a commitment to hire a new software developer. I was curious given we're hearing the same thing from Google and a lot of others out there, how has the environment changed in terms of attracting and retaining and compensating developers as you move your platform into more advanced innovation?  

JEFF BEZOS: I think we're doing very very well. I think in general the market for top talent is competitive. I think it will continue to be competitive. I think that is a worldwide phenomenon, and I think we're in a very fortunate position because we are doing some very exciting things. And so we're able to attract top talent. I think if you were not doing very exciting things, it would be a very tough world out there.  

PAUL KEUNG: But would you say it costs more to hire a developer today than what you thought it would cost six to nine months ago?  

JEFF BEZOS: No.  

OPERATOR: Bob Peck, Bear Stearns.  

BOB PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Just a couple of quick questions here. First of all, could you comment on pricing of keyword search and how you have seen that over the last quarter? We have had some competitors of yours say they are seeing somewhat of a bubble in the middle area of the bell curve of keywords, and I wanted to get your thoughts on that.  

Two is, we're also hearing that there is pretty strong success over at Joyo.com, so could you update us on China? And lastly (technical difficulty)-- integration and what (technical difficulty)-- going from here?  

JEFF BEZOS: Could you just repeat the last part of the question? I'm sorry you were breaking up a little bit.  

BOB PECK: It is just on A9 integration and where you see A9 going from here?  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, I will take the A9 one. There are two pieces of what A9 does. They do the Amazon product search for us and for our partners, our Merchant.com partners, where we provide the plumbing for other people to operate their websites in a private-label fashion.  

And then they have a consumer facing piece Web search called A9.com. A9.com has in this quarter redesigned their user interface. I think the team did an amazingly good job on that, and it is definitely worth checking out. So they moved the buttons on the right hand side to become tick boxes at the top, and there was a lot of work that went into that change in terms of testing it and making sure it was a significant improvement. I think it is and you should check that out and judge it for yourself.  

Basically what they do is they take some of the server side technologies that Amazon.com has innovated over the years like greeting the searcher by name and then remembering the history of searches. This is a particularly valuable service for people who are heavy searchers who may want to remember what searches they did three months ago, six months ago. As well as deploying for A9 toolbar users server side bookmarks so that as you go around and bookmark things, you can find the things you bookmarked from your office or from your home, from any computer that you have access to.  

So there are a number of things like that, people who visited this website also visited this website. It is the analog to the Amazon.com customers who bought this, also bought that. Those are the kinds of innovation that A9 is layering into Web search. And their strategy is just to keep inventing and innovating relentlessly for years to come.  

BOB PECK: And the other question was on how Joyo is doing in China and keyword pricing?  

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of Joyo, we are certainly very pleased with the investment we made there. Keep in mind that it is a very long-term investment for us. You know it is very early, and so we're pleased with what we see. But again, we are going to continue to work to make the experience better for customers over time at Joyo.  

In terms of pricing on keywords, I don't think it is necessarily appropriate for us to comment on that. It is certainly part -- you know, we have a number of different online marketing that we do. When you look at our expenses so far for the quarter, it was flat from a percentage of revenue year-over-year. And again, also keep in mind that a majority of customers come to us free. They come to us because we continue to work on the customer experience, making sure we have the right pricing, the right selection and continue to try to make it more convenient for customers.  

TOM SZKUTAK: We don't break down any of our marketing channels and talk about the performance of this channel or that channel. But I can tell you that our most important marketing is lowering prices, offering FREE Super Saver Shipping. It does not show up in the marketing line, but we do consider it a kind of marketing. And improving the customer experience in terms of availability, how rapidly you can get the products, whether they are in stock, lowering prices, increasing selection, those are the things.  

So when you see that our marketing line has stayed roughly flat as a percentage of sales, what you should -- the way we're able to do that and still grow the business and grow free cash flow is by improving the customer experience, lower prices, bigger selection, better availability.  

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, Citigroup Smith Barney.  

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, CITIGROUP SMITH BARNEY: Two real quick ones. The other income line internationally has stayed fairly small. It looks like you have really tapped into an opportunity in the North American market. What is the timing like for tapping into that in international markets?  

And then secondly, Jeff, you had talked about the tech development spending. One of the benefits has been to improve the ability of third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. We had picked up in the past that that seemed to have been harder than third-party sellers would have liked. Can you talk about one or two things specifically that you have done to improve the process for third-party sellers on Amazon?  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure. One of the things that we have done is improve the rating system for sellers. We still have a tremendous amount of work to do there. We're integrating, improving the customer service side of that so that we will be able to treat change of address and things like that more consistently with the way it is done when it is an Amazon owned inventory sale.  

So those kinds of things, basically what we're doing is slowly and systematically step by step driving parity between the third-party seller and the Amazon owned inventory business. So those two experience from a customer point of view are as similar as we can make them.  

So we want to be at parity with these third-party sellers on our own website, open it up to them. If they can offer a better bargain to our customers or better availability, we want to cannibalize ourselves in that way. At the same time, we're driving very hard in our owned inventory business so that we can be effective competitors by driving productivity and fulfillment operations in relationship with vendors and so on and so on. So there is a tremendous opportunity on both sides of that business. We will work to push hard on both of them.  

We have also -- another example would be making it easier for people to give us the feeds of their inventory, so that feed processing has gotten much better over the years. We will continue to make those things better just as we have over the last 10 years worked hard at making fulfillment and customer service and all the other things we work on better.  

In terms of the first part of your question, you mentioned other income. I think you were referring to actually other revenue the way you described it in terms of the service business in international, and we certainly don't have any announcements to make related to that. But certainly it is an opportunity for us over time.  

The only thing we have announced is certainly the work that we're doing, working with Marks & Spencer that we announced in the first half of this year. Again, we will be a developing a website with them, a private-label website with them, servicing them. So again that is something that we announced earlier this year.  

TIM STONE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.  

OPERATOR: That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com first-quarter 2005 financial results teleconference. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). For opening remarks, I will now be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tim Stone. Please go ahead, sir.  

TIM STONE, VP, IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello and welcome to our Q1 '05 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&A.  

   TD
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today April 26, 2005 only and will include forward-looking statements. Action results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2004 annual report on Form 10-K.  

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation to these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2004.  

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP & CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Tim. This was another successful quarter for Amazon.com. I will start with comments on our financial results. Our ultimate financial measure and the one we most want to drive over the long-term is free cash flow per share. Trailing 12 months or TTM free cash flow grew 21% to $417 million driven by improvements in operating profit. As a reminder, free cash flow excludes stock-based compensation and includes cash taxes paid which is well below our booked tax provision due to our tax NOL.  

A combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 434 million shares compared with 432 million shares. Stock-based awards outstanding were 24 million or 5.7% of shares outstanding, down from 27 million or 6.8% of shares outstanding. We strive to efficiently manage share count to create more cash flow per share and long-term value for owners.  

Return on invested capital was 35% down from 38%. We calculate ROIC as TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus the average current liabilities. We now have $307 million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, up from $9 million a year ago. For ease of comparability, excluding deferred tax assets from this calculation, ROIC would have been 40%. Our long-term expectation remains achieving triple digit returns on invested capital.  

Revenue grew 24% to $1.9 billion or 22% excluding the $30 million benefit from year-over-year changes in the foreign exchange rate throughout the quarter. Unit growth was 26%, and third-party units as a percentage of total units were 27%, up from 23%. Active customer accounts representing customers who ordered in the past year were nearly 49 million, up 18%. Electronics and other general merchandise or EGM increased to 25% of worldwide sales in Q1 of '05 up from 22%. And on a trailing 12 months basis, we surpassed $7 billion in sales, 45% of which came from our international segment, up from 40%, and for the first time, EGM sales exceeded $1.8 billion representing one quarter of our trailing 12 month sales.  

Gross profit grew 27% to $458 million in Q1, and gross margin increased 53 basis points to 24.1% primarily due to increased third-party sales and a $23 million increase in other revenue, including amounts earned from our cobranded credit card agreement and our Merchants.com program offset by lower product prices, a $12 million greater shipping loss driven by increased adoption of free shipping and Amazon Prime and continued mixed shift to international and EGM. Although gross margins increased this quarter, I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate that we are optimizing for profit dollars not percentage margins.  

Before moving to operating expense line items, a few words about stock-based compensation. Previously we classified stock-based compensation expense in a separate line item on our income statement. In accordance with SAB-107, we're now classifying stock-based compensation within the fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A line item as we do for cash compensation. In our earnings release, we've included a reconciliation of these line items from what we reported to an amount net of stock-based compensation.  

Now I will discuss operating expenses net of stock-based compensation expense as we have in the past. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $330 million or 17.4% of sales, up 142 basis points. Fulfillment was $163 million or 8.6% of sales, up 22 basis points. To support our growth and that of our Amazon service partners, we extended our worldwide fulfillment capacity in 2004, including in Scotland and expect to further extend our capacity in 2005. For example, we plan to open unautomated lower capital fulfillment centers this quarter in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, each of which will primarily handle nonsortable product. Fulfillment also includes a $5 million charge from our Q1 '05 removal of certain North American fulfillment equipment from service.  

Excluding this $5 million charge, fulfillment would have been 8.3% of sales consistent with Q1 of '04. Marketing was $43 million or 2.3% of sales, up 7 basis points. Our marketing across targeted online marketing channels is largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates. Technology and content was $82 million or 4.3% of sales, up 72 basis points. We anticipate continuing to hire computer scientists and software engineers throughout 2005 to invest in further innovation for customers. We expect annual technology and content cost devoted to our solid platform, search, Web services, digital and other initiatives to increase in absolute dollars in 2005.  

G&A was $42 million or 2.2% of sales, up 41 basis points. The increase was due to an $8 million charge for possible settlement of outstanding litigation, as well as increases in employment cost, professional fees and legal cost. Excluding the litigation charge, G&A would have been 1.8% of sales consistent with Q1 of '04. We don't allocate stock-based compensation or other operating expenses to our segment, which is consistent with prior periods.  

Now I will talk more about our segment results. In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $1 billion. The last two quarters are the two fastest growth rate quarters in four years. Media revenue grew 17% to $699 million, and the last two quarters are also the two fastest growth rate quarters in four years.  

EGM revenue grew 25% to $282 million and in North America surpassed $4 billion in TTM sales for the first time. Gross profit grew 23% to $279 million, and gross margin increased 49 basis points to 27.2%, primarily due to a $23 million increase in high margin, other revenues and third-party sales substantially offset by our price reductions across product categories, product mix shift, Amazon Prime and free shipping. Free shipping and Amazon Prime savings drove an incremental $3 million of net shipping loss compared with Q1 of '04, effectively a $3 million price reduction for customers.  

North America's segment operating income decreased $10 million to $66 million, and operating margin declined from 8.9% to 6.4%. As a reminder, we had a $5 million charge for North America fulfillment equipment in Q1, and the majority of our technology and content costs are incurred in the U.S. with most of them allocated to our North American segment. Additionally much of the $8 million litigation charge was allocated to the North America segment.  

In the international segment, revenue grew 28% of $875 million, ahead of where North America was a year ago. Revenue growth was 24% adjusting for the $29 million year-over-year benefit from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 17% to $675 million. In EGM revenue grew 86% to $199 million increasing to 23% of total segment revenues, up from 16%.  

Gross profit grew 33% to $179 million, while gross margin increased 79 basis points to 20.5%, partially from greater third-party sales offset by increased free shipping, product price reductions and mixed shift. Increased customer adoption and savings from our free shipping offers contribute to an incremental $9 million of net shipping loss compared with Q1 of '04.  

International segment operating income increased $21 million or 51% to $62 million, and operating margin increased 108 basis points to 7.2%. The combination of operating income in our North America and international segment is our consolidated segment operating income or CSOI. Our segment information financial statement in our press release reconciles CSOI to GAAP operating income.  

CSOI grew 10% to $128 million or 8% excluding $3 million favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating margin declined 89 basis point to 6.8%. Excluding the $8 million charge for litigation and the $5 million charge for fulfillment equipment, CSOI would have grown 21% to $141 million.  

Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income declined $3 million to $108 million, and GAAP operating margin declined 155 basis points to 5.7%.  

As previously announced, we choose to adopt FAS 123R, the new accounting rules on stock-based compensation effective January 1st, 2005 earlier than required. Stock-based compensation increased $12 million to $19 million, including the $14 million impact from our early adoption of FAS 123R. Other operating expense includes amortization of intangibles of $1 million.  

Last quarter we said GAAP net income for 2005 would decline because we expected a tax provision in 2005 rather than the large tax benefit we had in 2004. Our provision for income taxes increased $58 million to $56 million in Q1, a 52% effective tax rate higher than the 35% statutory tax rate primarily due to taxable income associated with the Q1 '05 transfer of certain assets from the U.S. to the international locations. We expect these asset transfers to result in tax expense for financial reporting above the statutory rate throughout 2005 and beneficially impact our effective tax rate over time.  

On a cash basis, since we have tax net operating losses, these asset transfers will not have a significant effect on cash taxes paid. We expect cash taxes paid to be approximately $25 million in 2005 compared with $4 million in 2004. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash basis rather than a financial reporting basis.  

GAAP net income was $78 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $111 million and $0.26 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates of $12 million, GAAP EPS would have been $0.16 per diluted share. The $33 million decline in GAAP net income is primarily due to the $58 million increase in income taxes and a $12 million net benefit from our early adoption of FAS 123R. Because although FAS 123R decreased operating income by $14 million, it created a $26 million onetime benefit from the cumulative effect of accounting change, which is classified below operating income on our income statement.  

Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased to $1.15 billion. In Q1 '05 we repaid EUR200 million or $265 million of our 6 7/8 Euro denominated convertible notes due 2010 at par. Over the past 18 months we have repaid over $600 million of our convertible debt, mitigating potential dilution of over 6 million shares and reducing annual cash interest expense by over $30 million. Inventory increased 43% to $403 million, and turns decreased 17% to 15.5 as we took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors, bolstered inventory levels to optimize in stock levels across product categories and expanded the breadth of product category selection in our fulfillment centers. We will continue to increase our mix of direct buying and existing and new product categories enabling us to offer even lower prices to customers.  

Our investment in fixed assets which includes net capitalized software development costs increased 13% from a year ago to $245 million. Our capital expenditures were $26 million, over half of which was software development cost.  

Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience, convenience, selection and price. I will now share some of our recent progress for each of these inputs.  

We continue to innovate on behalf of customers to improve convenience. Recent examples include Amazon Prime. We're seeing especially heavy use of Amazon Prime in electronics, tools, kitchen and health and personal care. For $79 a year, Amazon Prime members get all you can eat free express shipping. Getting your items right away changes the way you use and think about Amazon.com.  

Amazon Prime members get unlimited express two-day shipping for free with no minimum purchase required on over a million eligible items sold by Amazon.com. Members can order as late as 6:30 PM Eastern time and still get their order the next day for only $3.99 per item and can share the benefits of Amazon Prime with up to four family members living in their household.  

With less than 90 days to go before its scheduled release, customers worldwide had already placed 700,000 pre-orders for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth book in this epic series. On www Amazon.com, HP6 has been the top-selling book for 18 consecutive weeks and is priced at 17.99, a 40% discount. And we are offering our U.S. customers guaranteed delivery of the book on its release date Saturday, July 16, 2005 for the same price as standard shipping, and the service is free for Amazon Prime members. Customer self-service, content and defect reduction initiatives across the organization and more robust order and product information on our website helped our worldwide customer service team again achieve an over 20% year-over-year reduction in content per unit.  

A9.com launched A9.com Yellow Pages helping users find and discover local businesses in a completely new way, including block view which shows street view photos of millions of businesses and their surroundings. A9.com Yellow Pages now has over 26 million photographs of 15 cities including five new cities this month -- Fargo, Houston, Miami, Phoenix and Washington D.C..  

A9.com also launched A9 OpenSearch, a collection of technologies built on top of popular open standards to allow content providers to publish their search results in a format suitable for syndication. OpenSearch enables content providers' results to be displayed anywhere, anytime.  

Any site that has content and a search box can choose to return results on A9.com using OpenSearch RSFs. Customers can now view search results from the New York Times, Flickr, Wikpedia and over 150 content providers at  www.A9.com .  

We have recently introduced some interesting fonts and useful new book features available on hundreds of thousands of titles. First sentences are included on the top of product detail pages. For example, at the top of the detail page of The Kite Runner, just below the title it says, "I became what I am today at the age of 12 on a frigid overcast day in the winner of 1975."  

Statistically improbable phrases are also on the top of product detail pages. On the detail page of the top seller Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking" underneath the first sentence content are the phrases rapid cognition, intuitive repulsion, sip test, adaptive unconscious and red decks. If you click on one of these words, we show you other books that also use these phrases.  

Also in the pop-up box on the cover images are books on related topics, concordance and text depth. Concordance is an alphabetized list of the most frequently occurring words in a book excluding common words. The font size of a word in the list is proportional to the number of times it occurs in the book, and you can hover your mouse over a word to see how many times it occurs or click on the word to see a list of book excerpts containing that word.  

For example, in the book Blink, the word man is mentioned 47 times and woman is mentioned 51 times. With text depths, we provide the number of characters, number of words and sentences, readability, index measures. We provide an educational level, reading ease scale and school grade appropriateness for the book and complexity measures such as syllables per word, percentage of complex words, those with over three syllables and words per sentence.  

For example, a (inaudible) has 6% complex words and a Flesch Kincaid Readability Index of 4.8, meaning it is appropriate for people with a fourth grade or higher reading level. In pioneering portfolio management, an unconventional approach to institutional investment has 31% complex words and a Flesch Kincaid Index of 16.2, meaning it may not be suitable for people without a college education.  

Our selection continues to increase worldwide. In April we acquired BookSurge, a global reader and inventory free book printing and fulfillment. BookSurge's catalog has thousands of titles that can be printed on demand and are available for sale on Amazon.com. BookSurge offers its inventory free book fulfillment network to publishers through BookSurge publishers services and to authors through BookSurge publishing.  

In addition retailers, wholesalers and distributors can leverage the BookSurge direct wholesale platform. The $1495 Philips HeartStart Home Defibrillator is a bestseller and the most wished for item in our health and personal care store. Content on the product detail page include a video customers can watch of the product in action and over 50 customer reviews, including thorough passionate reviews from paramedics, cardiologists and others with personal stories.  

Macy's joined our Merchants program and now offers its wide selection on Amazon.com, everything from exclusive Macy's brands like Inc. International Concepts Apparel and Hotel Collection Bedding to Macy's wide selection of jewelry, apparel, beauty, bedding, tableware and home furnishings products are now available to Amazon customers.  

Third-party sellers remain a key part of our selection expansion and active seller accounts. Merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months exceeded 925,000, up by a third year-over-year.  

We plan to continue expanding selection in existing categories and opening new categories worldwide in 2005 and thereafter. In addition, we will continue to explore opportunities for geographic expansion in the years to come.  

Finally, we continued with our strategy to continually lower prices for our worldwide customers. Our objective remains offering low prices every day and applying them broadly across our entire product range rather than discounting a small number of products for a limited period of time. We again lowered product prices on tens of thousands of media products worldwide in Q1 and on  www.Amazon.com . The average customer discount across both music video products purchase increased over 375 basis points year-over-year, including over 300 basis points on both books and DVDs.  

We also lowered product prices on thousands of EGM products in Q1, and the average customer discount electronics at Amazon.com increased by 40 basis points year-over-year.  

Worldwide adoption of free shipping increased again in Q1 when customers saved over $100 million in shipping through our free shipping offers and Amazon Prime. Continuing to lower product and shipping prices is an ongoing way of doing business. We look forward to working relentlessly further to lower prices throughout 2005.  

Additionally, we have made good progress with Merchants.com partners. We launched Diane Von Furstenberg's site, DVF.com. Next year we will be providing the technology behind a private-label branded website for leading UK retailer Marks & Spencer and its in store and telephone ordering and customer service systems. Oshkosh B'Gosh, a premier marketer of children's apparel and accessories and existing Merchants@ partner will use the Amazon services Enterprise solution for its online offering.  

Yesterday specialty apparel retailer, bebe and Amazon services announced it will be building a new private-label bebe.com website using our technology to provide bebe with tools to manage the content of the site to offer their online customers an experience that combines the distinct bebe brand with Amazon's shopping features.  

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our Q2 '05 guidance and the 2005 baseline expectations are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the Euro/pound, Yen, Canadian and Yuan exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impacts on both world events.  

While we're cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Let me also remind everyone that we mark our Euro denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a non-cash gain or loss for any movement in the Euro between reporting dates. We also have exposure to the Euro related to our interest expense on this Euro denominated debt. We incur a non-cash foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies, which are to be repaid among subsidiaries.  

Depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of outstanding legal matters could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial positions or cash flows in a particular period.  

Our effective tax rate in 2005 and beyond is subject to significant variations based on our corporate structure, timing differences and current tax laws. And our current guidance assumes FX rates remain approximate where they have been recently compared with the prior year period and that we don't regard any additional intangible assets or any further revisions to our restructuring-related estimates.  

For Q2 we expect net sales of between $1.675 billion and $1.825 billion or growth between 21 and 32%. GAAP operating net income to be between $50 million and $80 million or a decline between 42% and 7%. This includes stock-based compensation of approximately $35 million. Keep in mind that in Q2 '04 stock-based compensation under our prior accounting method and other operating income were a combined $15 million.  

Excluding stock-based compensation and other operating income, we would anticipate operating income to be between $85 million and $115 million or between -16% and 14% growth. For calendar year 2005, we expect net sales of between $8.175 billion and $8.675 billion or growth of between 18 and 25%. GAAP operating income to be between $395 million and $510 million or between a 10% decline and 16% growth. This includes stock-based compensation of approximately $115 million.  

In 2004 stock-based compensation under our prior accounting method and other operating income combined was $50 million. Excluding stock-based compensation and other operating income, we anticipate operating income to be between 510 and $625 million or growth of between 4% and 28%. And we expect free cash flow to grow year-over-year with capital expenditures including capitalized software development costs for approximately $175 million.  

Our financial focus is on long-term growth and free cash flow per share. We're confident that if we continue to improve the customer experience, including increasing selection and lowering prices and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will further expand.  

Thanks and with that, Tim, let's move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Thanks, Tom. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, please remind our listeners how to ask a question.  

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: Thank you. Could you comment on the expectation that you have for growth of free cash flow? I believe this was the first quarter that you had a sequential decline in the trailing 12 months free cash flow. And also in terms of the international growth you have been reporting, it appears to me, and I may be wrong on this as we had a quick look at the filing, but it appears to me that there was a noticeable drop in the growth rate in Q1. Were there any one-time factors, especially on the media side, that might have contributed to that, or is this related (inaudible) we should expect for national growth?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question, free cash flow grew 21% to $417 million on a trailing 12 month basis. And what you are seeing is we certainly saw higher inventories year-over-year as I mentioned in the opening remarks, you know, as we expanded existing and new categories, as we got our in stock levels up and we took advantage of buying opportunities.  

In addition to that, you are seeing capital expenditures increase year-over-year. You know we spent $26 million in CapEx in Q1. That is up from $9 million last year in Q1. And again, a big piece of that is more than half of the CapEx is actually capitalized software as we have talked about for the technology initiatives that we have underway. So that handles the free cash flow.  

You mentioned something about guidance going forward. The only thing we have said related to free cash flow for the year is that it would be up year-over-year.  

In terms of international, you know we saw international growth of 28%, up 24% year-over-year. Certainly our international segment has become more meaningful. Our revenue was $875 million, which is higher than our North America segment revenues were in Q1 of '04. And it is growing at a faster rate. So again, we're certainly pleased with what we see there.  

Obviously keep in mind from our overall growth standpoint we are overlapping to a smaller extent -- we had the benefit of a leap year last year. We had Easter falling into a different quarter, you know, year-over-year. So those are some of the impacts. But again, we are very pleased with what we're seeing in our international segment.  

Beyond the growth part that we saw I mean up 28% year-over-year, we saw segment operating income growth of 51% as well. So again, we're very pleased with our international segment.  

OPERATOR: Mark Mahaney, American Technology Research.  

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH: Two questions. The first is you have announced a couple of new merchant relationships recently. What is the status of expanding your merchant networks, Merchants@Amazon internationally?  

And secondly, when can you -- do you want to draw a line in the sand in terms of when the pro forma operating income margins can stabilize and then start to grow again there? Do you want to say it is the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of -- I will take the second part first -- you know again our goal is to maximize free cash flow per share over time. And as part of that, we want to maximize operating profit dollars to help grow free cash flow over time. So as we have said in the past, that is really our goal, and that is how we think about it.  

JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT, CEO & CHAIRMAN, AMAZON.COM, INC.: I will add on the Merchants.com piece, we're seeing as you can see from the recent announcements that we have been making, very strong interest in building private-label e-commerce websites for other merchants who want to have an Amazon.com like experience for their customers. We are offering not only the website, but we are also finding the people are interested in having fulfillment and customer service applications, too.  

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: A couple of questions. Can you in just looking at the Merchants.com strategy with announcements like Marks & Spencer and bebe and others, can you just characterize I guess it seems like a bit of an extension of the strategy you had on leveraging the platform from a technology and distribution standpoint, but somewhat nascent in terms of doing this over the past couple of years, why the need to kind of go expand from a Merchants.com standpoint now? Has there been a change in the marketplace among the retail partners you are working with in terms of amortization of e-commerce cost finally runout, off their P&Ls or something that has changed for them to look at outsourcing their platforms to you.  

And second, as it relates to international, obviously Safa pointed out the growth rate. But can you characterize how Germany is performing? Can you see anything unique or interesting about that market or changes in the economies that are influencing e-commerce growth rates as a whole in that marketplace?  

JEFF BEZOS: I will take the first part of the question on Merchants.com. Certainly from some of the recent announcements you are seeing we're getting some good traction in launching new partners. I don't think there is anything new there. Again, it is just a way that we can leverage our platform with these partners you know in a variety of different ways.  

TOM SZKUTAK: The only thing I would add to that is that we are seeing -- one of the things that you see is as people start to build e-commerce businesses of any scale, they find that scaling those businesses and making them operate at scale is much harder than when it is being done at very small scale. And so that is one of the -- that may be one of the structural things that you're seeing in the recent announcements.  

JEFF BEZOS: And in terms of the second part of your question, we have not broken out any of the individual countries within international. So I cannot speak much to Germany, except to say that we're certainly pleased with our total overall international results with revenues being up 28% year-over-year.  

JEETIL PATEL: From a cost standpoint and timed resources standpoint, what do you think it takes -- is it a significant investment on your part to launch incremental Merchants.com partners, or is it a leverage the tools that you have already built-up over the past several years?  

JEFF BEZOS: One of the things that you see in our technology and content line is us hiring more software engineers and computer scientists. One of the things that is happening there is we are investing substantially in our seller platform and the different pieces of that. But that is -- it is a single platform, so there is not an undue amount of custom software and development for these particular Merchants.com private-label solutions. So we are able to use the platform that we have been investing in over the years to service their needs.  

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Tom, I was wondering if you could talk about the other domestic or other North American revenue of $46 million? What is in that line item specifically that is causing the growth on a year-over-year basis, and do you see that staying at that level? And how should we think about the operating margin related to that?  

The second thing, I want to go back to international. What do you think your plan was implied in your guidance for the first quarter? It grew 28%, which obviously is a big deceleration. It has been talked about on the call. I'm just trying to understand where was it relative to what you thought? And the one thing that would have been a driver of it being below your expectations if that was the case.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of your first question, other revenue within North America, there are a number of drivers. The two principle ones are revenue from our credit card, cobranded credit card. The second is Merchants.com.  

In terms of international, you know we don't breakout our guidance between the segments. But as you can tell from the results that we had, our revenue guidance for Q1 was 1.8 billion to 1.95 billion. We came in at 1.9 billion, well within our guidance and certainly in the upper half of guidance. And again, we are not breaking out any individual segments or countries or categories within that.  

ANTHONY NOTO: Sure, no, I completely understand. I'm just trying to get a sense for did we forecasting 30% international media growth relative to 33% year-over-year in the December quarter, did we completely miss some year-over-year comparison, or did something fundamentally change your international media business just so as we can think about the business going forward we could better assess it. I'm just trying to focus on the difference between those two. Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Right. I think -- again, I don't think it is appropriate to comment on any specific categories or geographies as it relates to guidance. But keep in mind as you think about international and our total, first of all, we are overlapping a leap year, which again is a small impact.  

Also, the Easter and within Europe it is the Easter holiday period is in different quarters this year versus last. These are certainly known items to us when we put together our guidance.  

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, Lehman Brothers.  

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: I just had a couple of questions around Amazon Prime. I was just curious what kind of traction you are seeing versus your expectations when you first launched the program? And you mentioned a few categories that are having better adoption there. Are you really seeing a difference in the type of products that members are ordering, and also how it is impacting your average order value?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we are. We are seeing a disproportionate use in those categories that we listed. The program is off to a very good start, and it appeals to active customers, people who buy from Amazon.com multiple times a year. Convenience-oriented customers who don't want to take on the mental task of waiting to find a $25 order. Want to be able to adjust get things done off the top of their list and get the items fast. And it does change the user perception of Amazon.com. As you use it for awhile, you start to realize that you can use Amazon.com for a much larger fraction of your purchases than you thought you could when items were taking longer to arrive.  

OPERATOR: Mark Rowen, Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL: A couple of questions. First, in U.S. media the 17% growth and the 18% last quarter, which was an acceleration as you mentioned from the last four years, was there any mix shift from third-party to first-party sales that helped accelerate that, or was unit volume also up in those same levels? And I don't know if I missed it, but did you give out third-party sales as a percentage of units for the quarter?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. I will take the second half of the question first. Our third-party units as a percentage of the total was 27%. That is up from 23% last year.  

Mark, we don't give the split-out between third-party and retail units. But again, you characterized the growth correctly. The North America media growth, both this quarter and last quarter, were our two fastest quarters that we have had in the past four years. We're very pleased with it both from a retail and a third-party standpoint.  

MARK ROWEN: I'm not asking for the breakout of it. I'm just asking if there was a mix shift, and if that helped accelerate the revenue growth in the last couple of quarters?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I would say that we are -- the way I would characterize it is we're happy with -- we're pleased with the performance of both.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay. And could you give us an update on the Toys "R" Us lawsuit and what your plans are for this holiday season for toys?  

JEFF BEZOS: We're pleased with the way that is going. Beyond what we say in our official filings, we don't comment on active litigation. Certainly we will stick to that policy here. But we are -- we're in the process of and we will continue to supplement our U.S. toy selection with merchandise from other sellers.  

OPERATOR: Justin Post, Merrill Lynch.  

JUSTIN POST, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: Can you talk a little bit about your sources of traffic, where most of your traffic comes from, and how that has changed over time? Also, can you talk about the growing use of search comparison sites for shopping? Has that had any impact on your business?  

TOM SZKUTAK: The majority of our traffic has been and continues to come from people coming directly to Amazon.com. We also do a variety of online marketing to get people to come to the site. Our best marketing dollars we believe are first spent on customer experience which includes lowering prices for customers and the free shipping initiatives, Amazon Prime, etc.  

So we look first to spend dollars on customer experience and then on measurable marketing activities, and continue to see very strong what we call direct traffic, people coming straight to Amazon.com.  

JUSTIN POST: And do you think growing use of search has made people more price conscious over the last few quarters?  

JEFF BEZOS: No, I would not say that. I think that there is a long-term trend that has been going on for a much longer period than that and will continue over the next number of decades where customers have better and better information. And that is basically we optimize our business based on that belief, that customers will continue to be empowered with better information, and that will happen online and off. We're organizing our business over time to do well in that kind of scenario.  

OPERATOR: Bridget Niget, Lazard.  

BRIDGET NIGET, ANALYST, LAZARD: Hello. Hey, guys. I just had a question. I am trying to compare apples-to-apples, and maybe, Tim, this is better served off-line. But what is going on in the operating expense line, like, for example, (inaudible) intangible amortization, we had a North American asset litigation settlement. But apples-to-apples Q1 '04 and Q1 '03, if you want me to call you back off-line, that is fine, too.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Why don't I --  

BRIDGET NIGET: I don't know what is the cleanest way to handle that?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. If you're trying to get our operating income, probably the best thing to do, if I understand your question correctly, is if you look at our segment information and our press release on page 6, you will see the individual segments and you will also see the consolidated segment, and the consolidated segment operating income was $128 million, which we mentioned was up 10% year-over-year.  

Included in that 128 was the $8 million increase for possible settlements of litigation, as well as the write-down of the assets to remove from service of $5 million. If you take the 128 and you add the 13, you get 141 or a year-over-year increase of 21%. So that gives you a pretty good I think apples-to-apples comparison of consolidated segment results.  

BRIDGET NIGET: And in 2004, were there any similar adds or minuses?  

TOM SZKUTAK: No.  

BRIDGET NIGET: Okay, and then 2003 similarly as well, that is pretty clean?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I would have to go back to --  

BRIDGET NIGET: Okay. But that would at least put it out apples-to-apples to 2004?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Correct.  

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, CS First Boston.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CS FIRST BOSTON: Great. Can you talk a little bit more about the additional third-parties, the deals that you are signing, particularly the Marks & Spencer deal in Europe? Is there a potential for this deal to evolve over time to more of the third-party relationships that you have in the U.S. where you're able to include that inventory with your own? Can you also give us an idea of how the finances behind those kind of deals are going to work where we will see the income impact on the income statement as well as the segment breakdown?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the Marks & Spencer partnership, all of our arrangements are multi-year arrangements. We don't disclose specific details of any particular one, and I'm not sure to say much more beyond that.  

Again, we are excited about the relationship. It is certainly a very good one as it relates to a very (inaudible) reseller within Europe and in the UK. So we are excited about it.  

HEATH TERRY: You know, I'm not looking for really any specifics, but if you can just kind of talk about generally the structure of those kind of relationships, particularly obviously Marks & Spencer's covers a lot of waterfront in terms of product availability, to the extent that that would give you an advantage in expanding your product line outside of the U.S. where you still have a much broader product line in the U.S. relative to the bigger market share in Europe.  

TOM SZKUTAK: The arrangement does contemplate having that selection available on Amazon.co.uk as part of our Merchants@ program at some point in the future. And the Marks & Spencer partnership is a big win for Amazon services in Europe, and we are super excited about it.  

OPERATOR: Paul Keyung (ph), CIBC.  

PAUL KEYUNG, ANALYST, CIBC: Looking at -- I see some decent growth in your third-party business this year and this quarter. I'm just curious as to if you have been able to maintain your gross profit per transaction metrics for third-party versus your sort of traditional retail sales?  

TOM SZKUTAK: You know, we're certainly pleased with our third-party business and our retail business. We have not disclosed historical results or individual quarter results on third-party versus retail.  

What we have said in the past, though, is as we try to price these third-party relationships from a Merchants@ standpoint, we try to price them such that our contribution profit dollars per unit are approximately the same, and that is something that we continue to try to do.  

PAUL KEYUNG: And has it stayed the same over the last couple of quarters or so?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, again we have not disclosed any historical results on that. But it is certainly something on an ongoing basis that we try to do.  

OPERATOR: Robert Peck, Bear Stearns.  

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: I just had a couple of quick questions here. One is, could you comment on any potential DVD partnerships in the U.S.?  

Number two is, could you comment on your fulfillment and what you're doing there, taking initiatives to maybe lower that as a percent of revenues? Does it make sense to use PayPal? Maybe your own PayPal service?  

And lastly, how should we think about investments from Amazon? You think about 43 Things, the funding of Delicious, BookSurge, Moby Pocket. Could you give us an idea of how we should be thinking about that on a dollar basis as well as strategically?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of DVD, I'm assuming you are referring to our rental business. We have a DVD rental business in the UK. Beyond that, we will have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we will do in other geographies. But certainly it is very early in the UK, but we are pleased with what we see there.  

In terms of fulfillment, our team globally continues to try to make sure that we optimize for customers, as well as get efficiencies over time. So we will continue to do that. That includes everything certainly from our traditional CS and fulfillment costs, as well as our credit card fees as well.  

You mentioned PayPal. Certainly I would not comment on that, but we're certainly always trying to do the right thing in terms of having the right payment methods for customers.  

And then the last part of your question, I'm sorry was what again?  

ROBERT PECK: On your investment strategy going forward, you know with the funding of Delicious, 43 Things, Moby Pocket, BookSurge, how should we in the investment community think about the dollar amount going forward as far as investments, as well as probably more importantly the strategic direction for the Company?  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, we have always said that we are -- certainly we have used a lot of dollars to develop technology internally to make sure we do the right things for customers over the long-term where we see opportunities as well to supplement that externally. These are some examples of that. We will certainly do that.  

Some of the things that we are able to invest in dollarwise can be quite small. In terms of executive bandwidth or distractions, it can also be quite small as long as they are separable and not conflated with other things that we are doing. So that is certainly a factor that we take into consideration.  

When you look at where we are investing more significantly, we're looking at areas like our seller platform, like our digital initiatives, and there are a number of things where other customer experience initiatives on the website that where we continue to increase the amount of spending, and you can see that in our technology and content line.  

TIM STONE: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website at least through the end of the quarter, and we appreciate your interest in Amazon.com. We will look forward to talking to you again next quarter.  

OPERATOR: That does conclude today's conference call. I would like to thank everyone for their participation.

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by and good day, everyone. Welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2004 financial results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tim Stone. Please go ahead, sir.  

TIM STONE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Hello. Welcome to our Q4 '04 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, who will begin the call by discussing Amazon's first ever membership service; and Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Both Jeff and Tom will be available for Q&A.  

   TD
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect managements views as of today, February 2, 2005 only. It will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our 2003 annual report on Form 10-K.  

As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against results for the comparable period of 2003.  

Before Tom reviews the results, let me now turn the call over to Jeff.  

JEFF BEZOS, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, CEO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Tim. During the 2000 and 2001 holiday seasons, Amazon.com tested free shipping on our U.S. website with orders over $99 qualifying for free shipping. 6 months later, in June of 2002 we tested a lower minimum order of $49. 2 months after that we tested a lower threshold of $25, and in January of 2003 we announced our discussion to make free Super Saver Shipping on orders of over $25, a full time year-round offer. We plan to keep free Super Saver Shipping in place indefinitely and each of our international sites now offers free shipping.  

We knew our customers would benefit from free shipping, but we tested it carefully because we also knew it would be expensive for the Company. And it has been. In 1999 we generated a worldwide profit on shipping of $12 million, while in 2004 we generated a loss on shipping of $197 million. This is a direct give back to customers. As you know, free, Super Saver Shipping requires a $25 minimum order size. And customers who use Super Saver Shipping accept an additional 3 to 5 business day delay relative to our standard shipping, which means the customers receive their orders in approximately 8 to 10 business days.  

Today, I'm very excited to announce a new shipping innovation for our customers, Amazon Prime, our first ever membership program offering all you can eat express shipping. The program is simple. For a flat membership fee of $79 per year, Amazon Prime members get unlimited express 2-day shipping for free with no minimum purchase requirements. Amazon Prime members also can choose overnight shipping for only $3.99 per item. Keep in mind that customers normally pay $9.48 for 2-day shipping on a single book and $16.48 for overnight shipping. In addition, Amazon Prime members can place their orders as late as 6:30 p.m. Eastern time and still receive their item overnight for only $3.99 or receive the item the day after that for free. With these cut off times, members can make their purchase decisions late in the day and still get their items quickly.  

With Amazon Prime membership, there's no minimum purchase to think about, no need to combine items into a single order and with Amazon Prime there's no fretting over whether to indulge in express shipping. After paying a fixed annual fee, members have peace of mind throughout the year to buy as many items as they like, pay no additional shipping charge and get the orders sent quickly to the their door. It's easy to become an Amazon Prime member, if you are already an Amazon customer you can sign up for membership with 1 click.  

At no additional cost, Amazon Prime members can share the membership with up to 4 family members living in their household. So for example, a husband and wife can pay a single $79 membership fee, but still shop separately using their only Amazon accounts and getting their own separate personalized recommendations. When you become a member, our product detail pages will appear differently for you. There will be a special horizontal buy box at the top of each detail page with a drop down list of shipping addresses and special Amazon Prime buy buttons to order items overnight for $3.99 or express 2-day for free.  

We expect Amazon Prime to be expensive for the Company in the short term, perhaps the most expensive thing we've done since free Super Saver Shipping. However, over the long term, we believe it will drive incremental demand just as Super Saver Shipping has done. Super Saver Shipping is one of the factors driving free cash flow and North American growth, including North America media, in Q4, both of which grew at their fastest rate in 16 quarters.  

Amazon Prime improves the customer experience and simplifies the decision process for customers. One of the great things about Amazon Prime is it applies broadly across our many categories, including books, music, DVDs, consumer electronics, tools, kitchen, house wares, apparel, jewelry, watches, health and personal care and more. For a single annual fee, members can get expedited shipping for free on over 1 million in-stock products across our dozens of categories.  

We will be closely monitoring Amazon Prime on metrics, such as shopping frequency and conversion. As with lower product prices, expanded selection, improved convenience, continued technology innovations and free Super Saver Shipping, Amazon Prime is good for customers. And over the long term, the interest of customers and shareholders are aligned.  

Now I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, SVP, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Jeff. This was another successful year and quarter for Amazon.com and we are grateful to our customers, our global teams and our partners for helping deliver these results.  

Let me start by reviewing 2004 in full. Free cash flow grew 38 percent to $477 million, driven by improvements in revenue and operating profit. The combination of common stock and stock-base awards outstanding was 434 million shares compared with 433 million a year ago. Return on invested capital increased to 44 percent, up from 38 percent, calculated at trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. Our long-term expectation remains achieving triple-digit returns on invested capital.  

Revenue grew 31 percent to $6.92 billion or 26 percent excluding $276 million of favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And our international segment reached sales of over $3 billion. Gross profit grew $345 million to $1.6 billion and gross margin declined 73 basis points to 23.1 percent driven by lower prices, increased adoption of free shipping and continued mix shift from North America to international and from media to electronics and other general merchandise. Offset partially by an increase in other revenues and third-party sales.  

Consolidated segment operating income grew 36 percent to $490 million or 30 percent excluding the $20 million of favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Operating margin improved 22 basis points to 7.1 percent. North America segment operating income grew $38 million to $321 million while segment-operating margin decreased 35 basis points to 8.3 percent. International segment operating income more than doubled to $169 million and segment-operating margin improved 161 bases points to 5.5 percent.  

It remains our long-term expectation that worldwide operating margins will reach the low double digits. That said, the Company's goal is to maximize profit dollars not percentages, ultimately maximizing free cash flow and free cash flow per share.  

Turning to the balance sheet, inventory increased 63 percent to $480 million, an average 5 percent of revenues. Inventory turns decreased from 18 to 16 as we took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors, bolstered inventory levels to optimize in-stock levels across product categories and expanded the breath of product category selection in our fulfillment centers. We will continue to increase our direct buying efforts in existing and new product categories, enabling us to extend even lower prices to customers. We again had an operating cycle of greater than negative 20 days, which we believe to be sustainable over the long-term.  

Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, increased 10 percent from a year ago to $246 million. Our capital expenditures were $89 million, of which half was software development cost. Cash and marketable securities increased to $1.78 billion, including $55 million from favorable movements in foreign exchange rates, which benefited our cash balances held in foreign currencies. During the year we repaid $150 million of our 4 and 3/4 convertible subordinated notes and have separately announced today we will be redeeming 200 million Euros or approximately $260 million at recent Euro dollar exchange rates. And of our 6 and 7/8 Euro denominated convertible subordinated notes due 2010 at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These 2 redemptions combined to mitigate potential dilution of over 4 million shares and reduce our annual cash interest expense by approximately $25 million.  

Now, a few comments on the fourth quarter. On the income statement, revenue grew 31 percent to $2.54 billion or 26 percent excluding $85 million of favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Unit growth for the quarter was also 26 percent and third-party units as a percentage of total units were 26 percent, up from 24 percent in Q4 of '03. Gross profit grew 28 percent to $544 million and gross margin decreased 51 basis points to 21.4 percent driven by continued product price reductions, product and geographic mix shifts and a $22 million greater shipping loss offset partially by increases in other revenue and third party sales.  

Marketing expense rose 44 percent year-over-year to $58 million. We expect absolute amounts spent in marketing to increase over time. G&A costs increased 38 percent year-over-year primarily due to increases in professional and litigation costs. We expect absolute amounts spent in G&A to increase over time. Consolidated segment operating income grew 16 percent to $177 million or 13 percent excluding $5 million of favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Operating margin decreased 88 basis points to 7 percent.  

In the North America segment, revenue grew 22 percent to $1.39 billion, the fastest growth in 16 quarters. Media revenue grew 18 percent to $885 million; also the fastest rate of growth in 16 quarters, while EGM, or electronics and other general merchandise revenue grew 27 percent to $449 million, representing a record 32 percent of total segment revenues. And for the 4-day Thanksgiving weekend consumer electronic sales on  www.amazon.com  surpassed book sales for the first time.  

Gross profit grew 23 percent to $355 million, and gross margin increased 19 basis points to 25.5 percent. Primarily due to a $20 million increase in high margin, other revenues, and third party sales, partially offset by our price reduction of the cross product categories, product mix shift and free shipping. Free shipping drove an incremental $6 million of net shipping loss compared with fourth quarter 2003.  

In North America segment-operating income increased $8 million to $122 million, and operating margin declined from 10 percent to 8.8 percent due to higher operating expenses, including increased technology and content expenses. As a reminder, the majority of our technology and content costs are incurred in the U.S. and most of them are allocated to the North America segment.  

In the international segment, revenue grew 43 percent to $1.15 billion, accounting for 45 percent of worldwide sales. Revenue growth was 33 percent adjusting for the $83 million year-over-year benefit from foreign exchange rates. Media revenue grew 33 percent to $911 million, and for the first time was higher than North America media revenue. EGM revenue grew 96 percent to $237 million, representing 21 percent of total segment revenues up over 550 basis points. And for the weekend before Christmas in Germany, electronics and photo sales surpassed book sales for the first time.  

Gross profit grew 37 percent to $190 million, while gross margin decreased 66 basis points to 16.5 percent driven by increased free shipping, product price reductions and mix shift, partially offset by third-party sales. Increased adoption of our free shipping offers contributed to an incremental $16 million of net shipping loss compared with fourth quarter of 2003.  

International segment operating income increased $17 million or 43 percent to $55 million and the operating margin was flat at 4.8 percent. Pro forma net income increased to $394 million or $0.93 per diluted share compared with $125 million and $0.29 per diluted share for fourth quarter 2003.  

GAAP net income was $347 million, or $0.82 per diluted share compared with $73 million and $0.17 per diluted share for fourth quarter 2003. The $47 million difference between pro forma and GAAP net income was due largely to a $77 million loss on re-measurement of our Euro denominated debt and $20 million in stock-based compensation offset partially by a $44 million gain related to the impact of FX on inter-company balances.  

In Q4, based on our evaluation of the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, we determined that $363 million of our deferred tax asset is realizable through future operations and recorded a benefit of $244 million to our provision for income taxes and a direct credit to stockholders equity for $106 million. Excluding the $244 million benefit for income taxes, fourth quarter pro forma net income would have been $149 million or $0.35 per diluted share and GAAP net income would have been $103 million or $0.24 per diluted share.  

We expect net income for 2005 to decline because we expect a tax provision in 2005 rather than the large tax benefit we received in 2004. From a cash perspective we expect our taxes paid in 2005 to be approximately $25 million compared with $4 million in 2004. Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs of customer experience, convenience, selection and price.  

I will now share some of our recent progress for each of these inputs. We continue to innovate on behalf of customers to improve convenience. In addition to our new Amazon Prime membership program, which Jeff mentioned at the outset of the call, recent examples include, approved efficiency allowed our U.S. fulfillment centers to extend the standard shipping holiday deadline by an additional 2 days to December 20. While again shipping more than 99 percent of all orders in time to meet holiday deadlines. Demonstrated peak holiday unit capacity across our worldwide network increased 25 percent. On our peak day we received orders for a record 2.8 million units worldwide, or 32 items per second, a 33 percent increase over the peak unit day in holiday 2003.  

Our U.K. site introduced a DVD rental service featuring tens of thousands of DVD titles for next-day rental with plans that start from just 7 pounds 99 per month. In addition, rental members received an extra 10 percent discount off Amazon's already low prices on all of their DVD purchases from Amazon.co.uk. Results to date have exceeded our expectations and we remain well-positioned to offer this service in other geographies.  

Our Japanese site introduced Amazon's scan search, enabling Japanese cell phone users to scan bar codes at their local stores and retrieve a real-time Amazon detail page for the item scanned, complete with pricing information, customer reviews, and an ability to purchase the item with just 1 click. We believe over time pricing information in all markets will only become more transparent, on-line and off, which we view as a positive development relative to our model and strategy.  

We launched several new discovery features to help products find customers, including most wished for items, those recently added most often to wish lists. Top rated items, those rated highest by customers who recently wrote reviews. Popular gifts, items most often given as gifts by customers. And a self-explanatory, what similar items do customers ultimately buy after viewing this item. Customers across worldwide sites have already placed hundreds of thousands of pre-orders for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth installments in the popular book series due to be released on July 16, 2005.  

Our A9.com subsidiary launched A9.com yellow pages helping users find and discover local businesses in a completely new way, including Block View a powerful technology which brings the Yellow Pages to life by showing a street view of millions of businesses and their surroundings. Block View allows its users to see storefronts and virtually walk up and down the streets of currently more than 10 U.S. cities using over 20 million photographs. In addition, A9.com Yellow Pages uses features on Amazon.com that allow users to review, rate, provide more information, create lists and get recommendations on over 14 million businesses across the U.S. A9.com Yellow Pages are available now on the A9.com home page at  www.A9.com .  

2004 was another year of innovation as we substantially increased our technology teams. And in 2005 we anticipate continuing to hire computer scientists and software engineers to invest in further innovation for customers. We expect annual technology and content costs devoted to our stellar platform, search, Web services, digital and other initiatives to increase again in absolute dollars in 2005.  

In addition to our geographic expansion into China, we also expanded product selection across sites worldwide. We introduced 9 new categories worldwide in 2004, including new toy stores in Germany and Japan, these stores featuring over 20,000 toys, games and hobby products from Amazon with additional marketplace selection that were popular with customers during the holidays becoming the second biggest category launch in those countries behind books own a unit sold basis for the categories first 90 days.  

We officially launched our jewelry and watches store in the U.S. and introduced Beta version of beauty and musical instruments. These 3 categories combined have increased product selection by over 150,000 unique items. From November 25 to December 23, our jewelry and watches store sold more than 1 watch per minute.  

Our consumer electronic store is now directly sourcing extensive product selection from Panasonic and Sony and we have been named a strategic growth account by Sony Corporation. And in the December issue of Consumer Reports, Amazon.com was named the best place to shop for electronics for price and selection on-line and off.  

Third-party sellers are a key part of our selection expansion, and active seller accounts, merchants with an order from a customer during the preceding 12 months, reached over 850,000 in 2004, up 35 percent year-over-year. We plan to continue expanding selection in existing categories and opening new categories worldwide in 2005 and thereafter. In addition, we will continue to explore opportunities for geographic expansion in the years to come.  

Finally, in Q4 in 2004 we continue with our strategy to continually lower prices for our worldwide customers. Our objective is not to discount a small number of products for a limited period of time, but rather to offer low prices every day and apply them broadly across our entire product range. We continue to lower prices on hundreds of thousands of media products for sale at Amazon.com.  

The average customer discount across books, music and video products purchased increased over 200 basis points in Q4. Examples of price reductions include increased discounts on books over $15 from 30 percent to 32 percent. And we are experimenting with even greater discounts for different price points in book to genre, including 34 percent off books over $25, selected DVD top sellers are discounted 35 percent and every day mid-list title discounts have increased 1,000 basis points during 2004.  

Our German site introduced free shipping for all book orders with no minimum order amount and a DVD price guarantee. Customers finding DVD prices lower off-line or on-line receive gift certificates for future purchase equal to the difference in price. For the second time in 15 months, our UK site reduced the threshold for free shipping, dropping the minimum required order from 25 pounds to be 19 pounds in September 2004. Customers embraced the reduction this holiday period increasing their free shipping adoption substantially.  

Worldwide adoption of free shipping increased in Q4 and 2004, and customers again saved hundreds of millions of dollars with free shipping in 2004. Continuing to lower product and shipping prices is an ongoing way of doing business, and we look forward to working relentlessly to lower prices in 2005.  

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our Q1 '05 guidance in 2005 baseline expectations are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding the fluctuation in the Euro, pound, yen, Canadian dollar and Juan [ph] exchange rates, as well as the global economy, consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demands and therefore our actual result could differ materially from our guidance.  

Our operating results could change substantially if FX moved where they have been recently and we will not give intra quarter adjustments to guidance based on FX movements. Let me also remind everyone that we mark our Euro denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a non-cash gain or loss for any movement in the Euro between reporting dates. We also have exposure to the Euro related to our unhedged interest expense on this Euro denominated debt.  

We incur a non-cash foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intra company balances denominated in foreign currencies, which have been paid among subsidiaries. And our effective tax rates in 2005 and beyond are subject to significant variation base on our planned tax structure, timing differences and current tax laws. Given the inherent uncertainty in these non-operating items, it is not possible to accurately predict net income and net income per share, nor do we optimize for these 2 measures internally. Therefore, we do not provide guidance beyond operating income, which could roughly trend with free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We encourage investors to consider focusing their forecasting efforts for our business on free cash flow, free cash flow per share and the primary drivers of each, operating income and shares rather than net income and net income per share.  

Beginning with Q1 we don't intend to report or provide guidance on pro forma operating income or net income measures. However, we plan to continue disclosing stock-based compensation, other operating expense, re-measurements in other line items and our results of operations.  

For the March quarter, we expect net sales of between $1.8 billion and $1.95 billion, or growth of between 18 and 27 percent, assuming FX rates remain approximately where they've been recently compared with the prior-year period. Operating income to be between $80 million and $110 million. This assumes, among other things, that we early adopt FAS 123R on January 1, 2005, with resulting stock-based compensation of approximately $25 million, that we do not record any further revisions to our restructuring related estimates.  

Also as Jeff mentioned, we expect Amazon Prime to be an expensive investment in customer experience and our expectations do reflect estimated expenses associated with Amazon Prime. For the calendar year 2005, we expect net sales of between $8.05 billion, and $8.65 billion, a growth of between 16 and 25 percent, assuming FX rates remain approximately where they've been recently compared with the prior year.  

Operating income to be between $385 million and $510 million, this assumes among other things that we early adopt FAS 123R on January 1, 2005, with resulting stock-based compensation of approximately $115 million, and that we do not record any further revisions to our restructuring related estimates. Our full-year expectations also reflect estimated expenses associated with Amazon Prime. Capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs to be approximately $175 million. We expect free cash flow to continue to grow year-over-year.  

Before turning to questions, I want to take a moment to reflect back to our April, 2002, shareholder letter in which we talked about generating meaningful sustained free cash flow, while limiting share count growth by targeting net dilution stock-based awards on average of 3 percent. I'm pleased to report that in the 3 years since 2001, the Company has generated over $950 million in free cash flow while actually decreasing shares plus equity awards outstanding.  

While driving that free cash flow, we invested over $650 million in technology and content, innovating on behalf of customers. We drove higher adoption of free shipping and we continued to lower product prices, laying the foundation for future free cash flow generation. We remain committed to annual year-over-year growth and operating profit, free cash flow, and free cash flow per share while investing in long-term opportunities.  

Thanks. With that, Tim, let's move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question?  

OPERATOR: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question today is from Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Hi, guys. I had a couple of questions. The technology or product development investment continues at Amazon, and really try to want to understand as you look at investing in that area of the business, can you talk about when we should start to see the fruits of the labor? Is it something that is an ongoing process and we might start to see it as early as mid-year this year or do you think it's more of a second half event in 2006?  

Second question, you talked -- with the Prime service out there today and continued expansion that you are going to go after, it seems like you are balancing both frequency in terms of purchases and units relative to user growth. Can you talk about the ongoing effort of continuing to lower the pricing hurdle? Do you think that has a bigger impact on frequency or user growth in your business as you look forward now? And then just on your top-line guidance, increasing relative to the prior quarter, can you give us as of whether that's more of a function of the weaker dollar or is that a change in the unit growth assumptions as you look forward now?  

JEFF BEZOS: This is Jeff. I'll take a couple of those and maybe Tom wants to add on. First of all with Amazon Prime, the primary effect that we hope to see there in terms of incremental demand generation is with more frequency across more categories and increased conversion rates with existing customers. So while there may be some new customer generation as a result of that program, that's not the primary thing that we would anticipate. So it really is about getting customer -- earning more of the business from current customers.  

As far as investments go, whether they be in pricing things like Super Saver Shipping, Amazon Prime, technology, they tend to be -- to take -- if we look at the things we are benefiting today, things like international or category expansion or electronics business and so on, those are seeds that really got planted a few years ago and that's the kind of time scale -- the scale of the Company at this point when we start something completely new it has to grow for awhile before it has a meaningful impact on the Company's overall financials. So that's certainly the kind of time horizons that we look at when we are thinking about investments.  

The other thing I would say with respect to investments in general and our technology investments in particular, is that we don't expect our rate of investment to be constant quarter by quarter or year by year. There will be natural investment rates which correspond to what we see in the external marketplace, what's sort of going on in the world, and we feel if we were to level that out artificially we would miss opportunities in some years and probably over invest in certain other years. So you should expect that to not be constant.  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of your guidance question was that Q1 you're referring to, Jeetil?  

JEETIL PATEL: Just '05, relative to the prior quarter, what you talked about for '05.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Again, we increased guidance from what we gave 90 days ago, and revenue for the total year is going to guidance of 16 percent to 25 percent. Again, we are cautiously optimistic. We think the guidance is appropriately conservative. And that's where we see it.  

JEETIL PATEL: Just, how much of that change versus the prior quarter is more of a function of the weaker dollar relative to -- as opposed to unit growth?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, the way I would think about it is the exchange rates that we've assumed is where they've been recently. So that's all that we are providing.  

JEFF BEZOS: Thanks, Jeetil.  

OPERATOR: Our next question will be from Anthony Noto from Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much. A couple of questions. When you guys have given fourth quarter guidance in revenue and operating income there's always a match between the different ends of the ranges in terms of revenue and the appropriate operating income that would go with that. While you hit the high-end of revenue, which actually accelerated on a year-over-year basis of a growth rate which was positive, the operating income was not commensurate with the revenue performance. I was just wondering, was there some type of competitive factor that caused the cost of doing business to be higher than your guidance sort of implied in terms of the revenue and the corresponding operating income that would have generated before the fourth quarter?  

And also when I look at the incremental operating margin it continues to deteriorate down to about 4.1 percent to 6.5 last quarter, 11.7 the quarter before that and mid-teens a year ago. So I was just wondering if you can comment on both of those things as it relates to your investment versus competition and what you are seeing. And I have one follow up. Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS: Anthony, one of the things that I think the right light to view this in is we actually see this as, I was talking before, about investment periods not being constant or sort of smooth. We see this as an important time to be investing. We think that there are a lot of opportunities. And so when you look at software engineers that we are hiring, computer scientists and so on, that is basically because we really do believe that this is a great time to be investing in this business.  

ANTHONY NOTO: Great. So I definitely understand that lumpiness, but is there any change in the competitive environment either from the incumbent traditional brick and mortar guys that are maybe becoming more aggressive, the up-start shop and comparison sites or maybe even other electronic retailers? And then as we talked in the fall, your approach to potentially taking more inventory in non-books music and video category have primarily been third-party businesses, can you focus a little bit on that as you go into 2005 in terms of how aggressive you will be there and what benefits you think you may have gotten from lessons learned in the fourth quarter? Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, one of the things -- the basic answer to your question is no. But I will -- on the inventory piece it is -- it is the case that we have taken more in-stock inventory. One of the things that has driven the success, for example, of our electronics business over the last few years, that business has operated better, the pricing is sharper, the inventory levels are better so that there's in-stock availability across a very wide selection of things.  

And in fact, it's the broad in-stock inventory that makes -- across many different categories, that makes the Amazon Prime program doable at this point. So it really is that having that inventory on hand available for overnight shipping, which people can now get for $3.99 an item once they've paid for a $79 a year membership. So for a certain group of customers, this is a very important benefit and it comes from having this very sophisticated fulfillment network that has very high inventory turns across a very, very large number of different products across different categories.  

TIM STONE: Thanks, Anthony.  

ANTHONY NOTO: Great.  

OPERATOR: We have a question from Mary Meeker from Morgan Stanley.  

MARY MEEKER, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: And we have a few questions. To Jeetils question earlier, you talked about increase in frequency. I think you talked about an increase in cross shopping that might imply that conversion rates also rose in the fourth quarter. A bull could argue that what you are doing is offensive and long-term in nature and a bear could argue that what you are doing is defensive. Could you give us a sense, and I say that as it relates to Prime and the probable reduction in operating margins in fiscal '05.  

Could you talk about what you saw in the fourth quarter vis-a-vis conversion rates, frequency and cross shopping with more specificity and give us a sense if that's something that gave you more confidence that the Prime effort would be a successful effort. From the guidance that you gave previously, it appears as though the Prime concept in rolling it out, and the expenses associated with it, was something that evolved in the fourth quarter. So I assume there's some data that gave you the confidence to go forward with that. And in spite of that being a very long-winded question, I have a couple more if you will allow me.  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, in Q4 we have seen very good cross shopping as you suspected in your question. One of the pieces of evidence that we shared with folks of that being the case is the Thanksgiving holiday weekend where electronics surpassed our book business for the first time ever, even though our book business set a new record that weekend. You can also see that in the accelerated growth rates in our North America business. And so Amazon Prime is certainly what we see is this is a way for to us generate a very compelling customer benefit in a way that we are uniquely positioned to do well.  

To do something like Amazon Prime well, you have to have large in-stock selection. You have to have a fulfillment center network with multiple nodes so that you can have attractive shipping cost structure, and you also have to operate multi-category. Because it's probably not as worth it for a customer to pay an annual membership fee if they can only purchase in 1 product category. So there are a unique set of factors which really make Amazon.com ideally positioned to offer this kind of customer benefit. And that's really what's driving this.  

We see an opportunity to take our best customers, who are purchasing from us frequently and there are a lot of those, and offer them a new way of shopping at Amazon.com, which gets them to really experience this very differently. It's one thing to order something and get it a week later or 10 business days later in the case of Super Saver Shipping. It's quite another to all of a sudden start using this service in a different way so that as you order the things come very, very quickly. It just feels differently. And even for people who can afford second-day shipping, it feels sort of like an indulgent luxury. But turning it into a fixed cost makes it possible for people to do that without any guilt.  

MARY MEEKER: If I go to shopping.com, for example, and find a book that I'm interested in and Amazon has a good price -- a price that's compelling, what's the probability that I will see a price that also says, for Prime members, price would be X?  

JEFF BEZOS: I don't know, but certainly if you are paying $79 a year for a membership fee, you yourself are going to think about that price.  

MARY MEEKER: Yes. Can I ask 2 more questions, Jeff?  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure.  

MARY MEEKER: How will you recognize the $79 Prime revenue that you receive? And for the '05 range of operating margin guidance, what percent of that change versus the prior guidance is related to Prime-related expenses versus research R&D-related expenses, versus search R&D-related expenses for the A9 stuff, versus search's sales and marketing expenses? And that's my last -- those are my last questions. Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure, the first part of your question, Mary, in terms of the recognition, it will be amortized over the course of the year. So, again, it will be a straight line over the year. In terms of the other piece, could you just repeat the last part of it?  

MARY MEEKER: It's your operating margin range for '05 is wide and it's also, I think, somewhat lower than people were expecting. If you could talk about what percentage of your change in expectation is related to the new Prime launch versus search R&D spending, i.e., your A9 stuff, versus search sales and marketing spending, i.e., what you are paying to Google and Yahoo! for key words.  

JEFF BEZOS: Just to be clear, Mary, the guidance that we gave for operating profit is the same as we gave 90 days ago.  

MARY MEEKER: I'm referring to the margin level.  

JEFF BEZOS: Sure.  

MARY MEEKER: The margin percentage.  

JEFF BEZOS: Right. We had raised the top line. We kept the margin the same. So again there is a number of different factors that drove that. Again, it's difficult to --.  

TOM SZKUTAK: And Amazon Prime is certainly part of it.  

JEFF BEZOS: Of course.  

MARY MEEKER: Okay. Thanks, guys.  

JEFF BEZOS: Thank you.  

TIM STONE: Thanks, Mary.  

OPERATOR: And just a reminder, we do ask everyone to limit themselves to 1 question. We will go next to Lanny Baker from Citigroup.  

LANNY BAKER, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thanks a lot. One interlinked question, and that is to say, can you talk about the CapEx? It looks like, if I heard you right $175 million in '05 is about the same as the total across the last 3 years. And when I compare that to where it looks like the gross profits will be, capital expenditures are -- the business looks like for every dollar of gross profits it's becoming 2, 3 times more capital intensive than it's been recently. What is the change there? How long is that going to persist?  

And I guess, similarly, kind of following up a little bit on what Mary just asked, that is, if I look at the marketing expenditures relative to the gross profits in the fourth quarter, it was at probably the highest relative size to gross profit dollars over the last 2 years or so. Is there something going on there other than just the elevation of media prices? Is there an increased sort of media appetite from Amazon?  

TOM SZKUTAK: The answer to the first part of your question if the guidance is $175 million for CapEx in 2005, we spent $89 million in 2004. Just to give you a feel for the breakdown. As I mentioned in the earlier comments, approximately half of the 2004 relates to software capitalization. So you can imagine as we continue to hire more software engineers and computer scientists to work on all the technology programs that we talked about, you should see an increase in software capitalization as well. So it's certainly a significant portion of the 175.  

In addition to that, we are -- certainly with the growth that we are seeing in international, you can assume that we may have to add capacity in international during 2005. We also have the hardware requirements related to some of the work that we are doing, as well as additional new categories and business expansions that we have planned. So those are the key pieces, but certainly software development will be the most significant pieces.  

LANNY BAKER: Thanks, Tom. Just one other point on that. What's the -- how many years does the capitalized software get amortized versus the other stuff?  

TOM SZKUTAK: It's 2 years.  

LANNY BAKER: 2 versus 7 on average in the other?  

TOM SZKUTAK: And it varies depending on the type of activity.  

LANNY BAKER: Okay, thanks. And then the question on the marketing intensity? Does that reflect the media environment or is there a change there?  

TOM SZKUTAK: It's -- again, the marketing spend is what you are referring to? Is certainly up year-over-year, but it's just we still think it's a very modest spend, just over 2 percent of revenue.  

JEFF BEZOS: If you look at the absolute numbers spent, it's, for example, smaller than our shipping loss in the same time period.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Right. We spent $58 million in marketing spend. Our shipping loss for Q4 was $78 million, for example.  

LANNY BAKER: Right. So is the answer then there's no real change in marketing MO?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Right.  

LANNY BAKER: Okay. Thank you.  

TIM STONE: Thanks, Lanny.  

OPERATOR: We have a question from Shawn Milne from Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.  

SHAWN MILNE, ANALYST, FRIEDMAN, BILLINGS, RAMSEY: Thank you. Not to beat a dead horse, I wanted to go back to technology spending. Tom, can you give us a little bit more color, will technology spending grow faster than revenue in 2005? Could you break out just the biggest buckets within technology spending, the highest incremental spending? And if you can give any color on what you might spend in A9? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we are not giving any specific guidance, Shawn, on any of the line items. What we have said, though, is we expect certainly the technology and content expenses will grow again in 2005. As Jeff had mentioned earlier, it won't be necessarily smooth from year to year, as we see opportunities that we feel are good for our long-term shareholders we will invest in those. As we mentioned in some of the opening comments, we are going to continue to invest in improving the customer experience. We are going to continue to invest in A9 Web services, digital. So those are the things that we certainly see long-term opportunities.  

SHAWN MILNE: Do you have a year-end headcount in engineering and some kind of target for year-end 2005?  

TOM SZKUTAK: No. We haven't disclosed it, but again, we've been very successful in hiring some very top software engineers, computer scientists. We are very pleased with that and we are certainly trying to do more of that in 2005.  

SHAWN MILNE: Thanks, Tom.  

OPERATOR: We have a question from Heath Terry from CS First Boston.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: Great. I was wondering if you could kind of give us a bit of a drill down in terms of the way that you go through the thought process on price reductions. We saw pretty significant revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. But free cash flow growth lagged significantly. Can you walk us through how you evaluate those and do you have maybe some examples you can give about, in terms of where the leverage really is in a price reduction actually driving higher free cash flow either during the quarter or just in kind of a theory example?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Just to correct something you said, our revenue growth for the year was 31 percent. Our free cash flow grew 38 percent. So we are getting leverage while again, as Jeff mentioned earlier, a lot of these things, price reductions and the technology initiatives that we have in place do take time, but again, you are seeing good leverage free cash flow.  

HEATH TERRY: And can you talk about maybe in a product category where you've done these price reductions where you've seen that kind of leverage?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, I think if you look at kind of what I said before, but electronics, consumer electronics is a good example of something that we have been investing in for approximately 4 years now, the business from a customer experience point of view and from an operating efficiency point of view has gotten better every year and we expect that to continue. And that is what's driving the -- that's an example of an investment that we started making many years ago. It's now large enough to actually influence the overall financials of the Company.  

HEATH TERRY: Great. Thank you.  

TIM STONE: Thanks.  

OPERATOR: We have a question from Safa Rashtchy from Piper Jaffray.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: Thank you. A question on the growth rate of electronics and other, as I understand your electronics and other categories has basically been stagnant at about 27 percent year-over-year growth for the past 3 quarters, while the media segment, as you noted, actually accelerated growth. Given the announcements you had about improvements in more electronic sales, I would have expected an accelerate of that. I know that the strategy for Amazon has been to kind of portray the Company more as a general merchandise store rather than just books, music and video. Is there any other initiatives that you have to take to accelerate the growth in electronics?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, just a comment on the growth rates. The numbers you were reciting were the North America growth, our electronics and other general merchandise globally grew 45 percent year-over-year, which is certainly significantly above our 31 percent growth rate globally. Again, we are seeing very strong growth and it's been fairly consistent over a few quarters. We are certainly pleased with the growth that we are seeing and we will continue to focus on the right inputs to try to drive growth even further. Certainly there is, within Q4, there is certainly some mix that's in those electronics and other general merchandise as well that's impacting it.  

SAFA RASHTCHY: I'm sorry, mix on what?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm sorry?  

SAFA RASHTCHY: You said mix, I missed that, you said the electronics has mix in products that is slowing the growth rate? I just want to clarify that.  

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm saying it's a bigger percentage of our overall total during Q4. It was a bigger base.  

SAFA RASHTCHY: Okay. Thank you.  

OPERATOR: We have a question from Aram Rubinson from Banc of America.  

ARAM RUBINSON, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: Thanks. A couple questions. On the site I noticed that in the apparel section, as an example, you changed the way you merchandise it from being kind of a top-seller approach to being an editors picks. I'm curious if there are other areas around the site that you merchandised differently that I might not yet have picked up on? And then I have a quick follow up.  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, a lot of our merchandising is done by basically by algorithms and some of the merchandising that we have been very successful with is things like customers who bought this also bought this and so on and so on. There are a number of such things, personalized merchandising. We're very fortunate because we operate in an environment where those things are very measurable and so we can usually do very straight-forward tests where we don't have to guess about what works better. Does A work better than B? We can actually try both things. And no, the answer instead of trying to guess at it.  

The cost of doing such experiments in our environment is much lower than it is in the more traditional retailing environment. At the same time, the inputs that we put into those algorithms, I think we are starting to over time be better merchants. So I think that that's still one of those things where we will be improving for years and years and years and we look forward to that.  

ARAM RUBINSON: The second question and it will be brief, is I'm trying to understand what behavior you are trying to drive with the Amazon Prime. It sounds to me as if the behavior you are encouraging is more frequent, but smaller value orders, and I'm curious if that's correct and if that's a behavior you prefer, or if you prefer fewer but larger orders.  

JEFF BEZOS: Well, I think if we got to choose, we would prefer more frequent larger orders. But really what we are -- our economics more followed the units rather than the order size, and so what we are really trying to drive is more units whether they come in in big orders or smaller orders. So there is some fraction of our economics which follow order size and some fraction of it that follows unit size -- I'm sorry, follows the units. But we really, in this case, what we are trying to do is create a better experience for the large fraction of our customers that already shop with us frequently and hopefully they shop with us even more frequently. That's what will over time make this program work for Amazon's shareholders. It works very well today for the customers who use it.  

ARAM RUBINSON: Just tell us the number of customers that you've added? It's something you've talked to in the past and then I will leave you be.  

TOM SZKUTAK: It's 47 million, it's up 19 percent.  

ARAM RUBINSON: Thank you.  

OPERATOR: We have a question from Robert Peck from Bear Stearns.  

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Jeff, I know in the past you've mentioned the idea of Amazon expanding into services and a lot of people have taken that to mean Netflix or DVD type services. Can you talk a little bit more about what other services you see as potential products for Amazon going forward?  

JEFF BEZOS: One of the things that we have been very successful with is providing third-party services for other companies that want to participate in e-commerce, both in terms of making our Web services to them and you can learn more about that by going to Amazon.com/webservices. And also through our programs where we help merchants acquire on-line customers through merchant sat [ph] and then where we also operate both the website and the fulfillment infrastructure for other merchants as we do for Target, for example, if you go to target.com, that's operated on top of Amazon.com technology.  

ROBERT PECK: And, Tom, could you maybe talk about any sort of impact from EBAY increasing its prices? Have you seen any pick up at all from third party?  

TOM SZKUTAK: We have a longstanding policy of not talking about other companies. Our marketplace business has been doing extraordinarily well and it continues to do very, very well.  

ROBERT PECK: As you look at on-line search, some of it consider it sort of a distribution method for you, advertising, marketing, others sort of consider it more of competitors. What's your view of on-line search and how it's changing and shaping the landscape of e-commerce?  

JEFF BEZOS: Our view of on-line search is it is a piece of a very large trend that is -- that will go on for a long time, which is the consumers more and more every passing day, every passing year and decade have more perfect information and more transparency. So consumers are becoming more and more empowered. They are able to quickly find exactly -- they will be able to find out the correctness about things. We operate our entire business based on the believe that customers are smart and that they are going to be empowered with perfect information.  

ROBERT PECK: And as we try and gauge longer term here in margins, it looks like your guidance for '05 is for margins to come down a little bit. Does there come a level where you think the margins sort of flatten out and you can get some of the other operating components in your model?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, as Jeff had mentioned earlier, we expect it not necessarily it to be smooth. We've made good progress in operating margins over the last few years. Back in 2001 our operating margins were negative. 2004 our operating margins were 7 percent. As we see investment opportunities, we're clearly -- that we think are right for the long-term, we are clearly going to make sure that we invest in those. So you will see some years where our expenses will grow at faster rates than others. I think at the end of the day though we're all about how do we maximize for free cash flow for our shareholders and that's what we are going to focus on. And so we think that's the right thing and that's what we are going to optimize for.  

ROBERT PECK: Thanks, guys.  

OPERATOR: And we will take our final question today from Bridget Niget from Lazard Asset Management.  

BRIDGET NIGET, ANALYST, LAZARD ASSET MANAGEMENT: My question has been answered. Thanks.  

TIM STONE: Great. Thank you.  

JEFF BEZOS: Thank you, everybody.  

OPERATOR: That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

OPERATOR: Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com third-quarter 2004 financial results teleconference. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tim Stone. Please go ahead.  

TIM STONE, VP IR, AMAZON.COM: Welcome to our Q3 '04 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO, Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, will be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 21, 2004 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.  

   TD
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2003 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2003. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM: This was another solid quarter for Amazon.com as we continued to improve our worldwide customer experience through broad product selections, low prices and shopping convenience. Let me start with a few comments on our financial and operating results.  

Free cash flow on a trailing twelve-month basis grew 76 percent to $420 million, driven by organic growth in revenues and operating profit, and improvements in our operating cycle. The combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 434 million shares, essentially flat with a year ago.  

On the income statement revenue grew 29 percent, gross profit grew 24 percent, while gross margin decreased 87 basis points. Consolidated segment operating profit grew 29 percent. Operating margin was flat, and pro forma net income grew 52 percent.  

Revenue grew 29 percent to $1.46 billion or 24 percent after the $57 million favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Unit growth was 30 percent. Consolidated segment operating expenses, which declined 88 basis points as a percentage of sales, were up $48 million year-over-year, or $41 million adjusted for foreign exchange rates.  

Fulfillment increased $28 million due to variable cost corresponding with sales volume, our mix of product sales, credit card fees and bad debt costs, including processes associated with our guarantee for certain third party seller transactions.  

Additionally, our second UK fulfillment center in Scotland is now shipping orders and fully operational. We expect the absolute amount spent to fulfillment to increase over time. Technology and content grew $11 million as we were adding top computer scientists and software engineers to enhance the customer experience on our website and websites powered by us, and to improve our process efficiency.  

Additionally, we continue to invest in several areas of technology, including seller platform, A9.com, Web services, and additional development centers. We intend to continue investing in these and other initiatives. And we expect absolute dollars spent in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add computer scientists and software engineers to our staff.  

Marketing costs grew $5 million. We expect absolute amounts spent in marketing to increase over time as our marketing expenses are largely variable. We use a number of targeted online marketing channels to direct customers to our website. To the extent there's increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shift, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense.  

G&A increased $4 million primarily due to higher professional fees. We expect absolute dollars spent in G&A to increase over time. Consolidated segment operating income grew 29 percent to $95 million, and operating margin was flat at 6.5 percent. Adjusting for the $4 million benefit for foreign exchange rates operating income grew 23 percent.  

Trailing twelve-month consolidated segment operating income was $466 million, up $156 million year-over-year, including $21 million of benefit due to FX. Trailing twelve-month consolidated segment operating margin increased 82 basis points to 7.4 percent.  

In the North American segment, revenue grew 15 percent to $816 million. Media revenue grew 12 percent to $564 million. Top sellers in media this quarter included the Star Wars Trilogy DVD, and Jimmy Buffett's latest CD, License to Chill. EGM, or electronics and other general merchandise, revenue grew 27 percent to $229 million, and represented 28 percent of North America revenue, up from 25 percent.  

For the first time EGM revenue for the trailing twelve-month period was over $1 billion. EGM top sellers for the quarter include Apple iPods, Similac baby formula, the Sims II video game and Sony Ericsson mobile phones.  

Gross profit grew 11 percent while gross margin decreased from 28.4 percent to 27.4 percent as a result of free shipping, product mix shifts, continued price reductions and lower other revenue related to marking revenue, offset partially by increased sales volume from third party sellers.  

North America operating profit declined $5 million or 8 percent to $57 million. And operating margin declined from 8.8 percent to 7 percent due to lower gross margins and higher operating expenses. The majority of our technology and content costs are incurred in the U.S., and most of them are allocated to the North American segment, including expenses related to our seller platform search and Web services initiatives.  

Increased adoption of free shipping contributed to an increase of $7 million in net shipping loss compared with third quarter of 2003. In the international segment revenue grew 52 percent to $646 million, representing 44 percent of worldwide sales. Revenue growth was 39 percent adjusting for the $56 million benefit from foreign exchange rates.  

Media revenue grew 41 percent to $530 million. As in the U.S., Star Wars Trilogy DVD was the best-selling international DVD title, setting a record for pre-orders in the UK with 85,000. EGM revenue grew 132 percent to $116 million and represented 18 percent of international revenues, up from 12 percent.  

Gross profit grew 56 percent, while gross margin increased from 19.9 to 20.5 percent, primarily due to more third party sellers, offset by changes in product mix, price reductions and free shipping.  

International operating income grew $38 million, and operating margin expanded from 2.6 percent to 5.8 percent. Pro forma net income increased 52 percent to $73 million or 17 cents per diluted share compared with 11 cents per diluted share. On a trailing twelve-month basis pro forma net income, a component of free cash flow, was $370 million or 87 cents per diluted share. Our GAAP net income was $54 million or 13 cents per share, compared with net income of $16 million or 4 cents per diluted share.  

On a trailing twelve-month basis, GAAP net income was $315 million or 74 cents per diluted share. Inventory was $357 million, up $73 million sequentially as we began preparation for the seasonal holiday period. Trailing twelve-month inventory turns were 17, down from 19 a year ago as we optimized in-stock levels and improved availability times by increasing the breadth and depth of our direct vendor relationships. We also added inventory in our new product categories.  

Our negative offerings cycle was over 20 days, and average inventory was 4.6 percent of trailing twelve-month sales. Our investment in fixed assets, which includes capitalized software development costs, increased to $227 million. Capital expenditures were $29 million for the quarter, and $70 million on a trailing twelve-month basis.  

Cash from marketable securities increased from 1.06 billion to 1.18 billion, including approximately $41 million from favorable movements in foreign exchange rates. During the prior twelve months we have redeemed $350 million in convertible debt that was otherwise due in 2009, mitigating over 4 million shares of potential dilution in addition to reducing our cash interest expense.  

In Q3 we used $72 million in cash to acquire Joyo.com Limited. Return on invested capital increased from 27 percent to 44 percent, calculated using what we believe is a conservative approach to both return and invested capital, trailing twelve-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus average current liabilities. Our long-term expectation is to achieve triple digit returns on invested capital.  

Our growth continues to be fueled by our persistent focus on the primary inputs of customer experience, selection, convenience and price. We expanded selection across our sites worldwide and increased our geographic footprint. We introduced toy stores in Germany and Japan. Customers now have their choice of over 20,000 toys, games and hobby products, and enjoy discounts up to 30 percent on many products.  

Inventory in both countries is anchored by Amazon with additional selection from marketplace sellers. Our newest U.S. stores have added over 1 million items for purchase since the introduction of apparel in November 2002. Our apparel store now features over 250,000 items in 2 million color and size combinations from over 400 merchants.  

Sports and outdoors offers over 300,000 items from more than 600 merchants. Health and personal care offers over 200,000 products from Amazon and third party merchants. Jewelry currently features over 100,000 items from Amazon and third parties, including diamonds jewelry from Amazon at industry low markups of less than 15 percent and significantly less for more expensive diamonds.  

Amazon Services has over 800,000 active seller accounts worldwide, including over 6,000 launched Merchants@ platform sellers ranging from well-known branded merchants like Liz Claiborne to smaller specialty retailers such as Cheerleading Company. Units sold from third parties now represent 28 percent of worldwide unit sales, up from 22 percent a year ago.  

We established our seventh global Web site by acquiring 100 percent of Joyo.com Limited, a British Virgin Islands company which operates the Joyo.com Website in cooperation with Chinese subsidiaries and affiliates. The Joyo.com Website is the largest online retailer of books, music and videos in China. Results from Joyo were not significant in Q3 and are not expected to be significant in Q4.  

We plan to continue expanding selection in existing categories and opening new categories worldwide. In addition, we will continue to explore opportunities for geographic expansion in the years to come.  

We continue to innovate on behalf of customers to improve customer experience. Customer self-service, contact and (indiscernible) reduction initiatives across all areas of the organization and more robust order and product information on our Website help our worldwide customer service team achieve a 32 percent year-over-year reduction in contacts per unit.  

Our A9.com subsidiary, in addition to improving search for Amazon.com and our merchants, unveiled a new stand-alone search engine,  www.A9.com to make search more effective. A9 helps users discover information from several powerful sources, including Web and image search from Google, text from hundreds of thousands of book titles from Amazon Search Inside the Book, movie information from the Internet movie database, and site information from Alexa Internet, both of which are owned by Amazon.com.  

We think of A9 as a search engine with a memory. With the A9 toolbar installed, your Web browsing history is saved so you can search through your entire history. A9.com uses your history to recommend new sites, to alert you to new search results, and to let you know the last time you visited a page.  

And A9.com is about more than just search. It helps you organize what you find. The toolbar diary lets you take notes on any web page, and reference these notes whenever you visit the page. Easy to use bookmarks allow you to drag and drop any search results directly to the bookmark area. And all your information is always searchable directly on the A9 search page.  

Lastly, because A9 stores all information on its servers, you can utilize the features I mentioned from any computer you use.  

Finally, we continue with our strategy to continually lower prices for our customers. Customer adoption of worldwide free shipping offers reached another high point this quarter, saving customers tens of millions of dollars. In the UK for example we continue to see increased adoption of free shipping as customers embrace the new 19 pound threshold, which was reduced from 25 pounds at the beginning of September.  

We continue to lower product prices on thousands of media and hard-line products. Books over $15 at Amazon.com are discounted by 30 percent. We're currently testing even greater reductions for books that meet certain price points and elasticity criteria. And in DVDs we have increased discounts for our mid sales range titles.  

Free shipping, increased product discounts, and Amazon-owned inventory in newer product categories are part of Amazon's ongoing everyday effort to lower prices. And we intend to further lower prices for customers during the holidays and thereafter. Our goal is to maximize gross profit dollars, not percentages, ultimately maximizing free cash flow and free cash flow per share for our shareholders.  

Before moving onto guidance, let me just say a few words about the upcoming holiday season (indiscernible) at Amazon.com. Preparations are underway at our customer service and fulfillment centers, including the hiring and training of seasonal employees. The receive and stocking process is well under way for toys, housewares, consumer electronics, and other popular holiday gift items.  

We are pleased to offer customers even more selection at lower prices during holiday 2004 than in years past. These great offers include a 1/4 carat princess cut diamond earring for just $79, eligible for free super saver shipping. Starting with Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, our buyers anticipate that mall jewelers will be marking down similar items to $99 to a $129 range, but Amazon.com customers can enjoy these items at everyday low prices in our jewelry store right now.  

And Creative Labs' full line of Zen Micro MP3 players are available for pre-order exclusively at Amazon.com for $249.99, also eligible for free super saver shipping. The Zen Micro comes in ten different colors, and should be a favorite for holidays with 2 -- 2,500 song capacity, 12 hour battery life, FM radio and other exciting features.  

I will now conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our Q4 '04 guidance and the 2005 baseline expectations are the order of trends that we have seen to date, and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions.  

However, there's a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the euro, pound, yen, and Canadian dollar foreign exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending, and the impact on both of world events. While we're cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand; and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Let me also remind everyone that certain stock awards are subject to variable accounting. We incur a non-cash charge or gain for any movement in our share price between reporting dates. We mark our euro denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a non-cash gain or loss for any movement in the euro between reporting dates. We also have exposure to the euro related to our unhedged interest expense on this euro denominated debt. We incur a non-cash foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies which are to be repaid among subsidiaries.  

And we cannot forecast these items, yet they could have a significant positive or negative impact on our results. For the December quarter we expect net sales of between $2.295 billion and $2.545 billion, or growth of between 18 percent and 31 percent.  

Consolidated segment operating income to be between $162 million and $222 million, or growth between 6 and 45 percent. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be $85 million or loss for the full year. For calendar 2005 we expect net sales of between $7.4 billion and $8.15 billion. Consolidated segment operating income to be between $500 million and $625 million. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be $150 million or less. Q4 and 2005 guidance assumes foreign exchange currency rates stay approximately where they have been recently.  

Amazon.com will continue to focus on relentlessly improving customer experience for our buying customers, our selling customers, and Web site developers, ultimately maximizing free cash flow for our shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Tim, let's move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question?  

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Brian Pitts with Morgan Stanley.  

BRIAN PITTS, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: A couple of things here. Obviously there is so many new things going on in online search. Can you talk about what you see yourself sitting in the game long-term, and what the potential impact on your expenses and CapEx are looking out? And then I've got a follow-up.  

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER, CEO, AMAZON.COM: If you look at A9.com they are really doing two things. The first is they have -- Amazon has been investing in search since the beginning 9 years ago, focused on e-commerce search. And A9.com continues with that work for both Amazon.com and our partner websites.  

And the second thing they're doing is they have the consumer facing Web site that Tom talked about in his remarks at A9.com that uses a lot of the kind of server side mentality that Amazon.com has built up over the years. So things like discovery features, recommendations based on your past history with A9.com. If you used A9.com toolbar it tracks which websites you been to, remembers those websites. It greets you by name. You can see which websites you been to, so that if you visit the Web site -- want to find a Web site you visited six months ago, you can easily do that. You can search on the websites you've already visited and so on.  

So it is -- it is a different strategy. And I think what you're going to find is that there will be a lot of different search engines taking different tactics, different strategies, different customer experiences, creating unique differentiation.  

BRIAN PITTS: Can you talk about the overall impact of the additional 1.57 percent discount from A9? What has been the take rate on that? And how has this cost been offset by revenue generated from sponsored links?  

TOM SZKUTAK: We're not breaking that out at this point. And we will continue -- it is obvious a great deal for customers. If you used the A9.com search engine, then automatically without any work on your part as a user, you get a pi over 2 or 1.57 percent discount on all Amazon.com purchases. And that is -- it is something we're not advertising and people are slowly discovering it.  

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST: Jeff and Tom, I have a couple of questions about what is changing your business. If I look at the marginal profitability of the business in the quarter, the year-over-year incremental operating margin is down to 6.5 percent. Well down from a year ago in the teens, and low double digits in March and June. And when I look your guidance at the midpoint it is calling for about a 6 percent incremental operating margin in 2005.  

The question is what is changing your business that is costing so much more to drive growth? Is it the relative value proposition outside of books, music and video? Is that not as appealing? Is it competition? Is there some other factors? And then I have a follow-up.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. If you look at our total operating expenses, we are actually up by 23 percent this year -- excuse me, this quarter -- versus last year. There's two big pieces of that. One is fulfillment and the other is technology and content. Our technology and content expenses grew $11 million year-over-year. And again that is -- again, to continue to invest in the business and some of the things I talked about in my opening remarks. So we're certainly investing in search. We are investing in a solid platform. We continue to invest in customer experience, Web services.  

Again these are things that we think can really help our future. And we are going to continue to invest in those. So that is the piece that you're seeing. Also, clearly you're seeing gross margins are down year-over-year. That is not a new trend, but again we continue to invest in low prices, making sure that we have the best possible value proposition for customers. We also had our super saver shipping adoption rate reach its highest point this quarter. Again, those are things that we think are beneficial to us in the long term as well as our customers. So we're going to continue to do those things. And we think it it will be good for our shareholders and customers over time.  

ANTHONY NOTO: How long do you think that level of investment will be until you get back to incremental margin that is in the double digits? Or do you think that you're long-term margins won't get back to the double digits? And then is the reason your operating income in the third quarter in the North American business -- is the reason that is down on an absolute basis year-over-year and sequentially due to the investments that you made, or is there some other trend there on your third party business that you have cut rates or changed rates?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. I will take the second part of the question first, the North America operating profit. Our gross margins are down year-over-year. There are a couple of reasons for that. One is we had some other historical marketing revenue that you'll see -- it is about $3 million -- that ran off last year Q3. The other piece is if you look at our shipping profit for North America that loss actually increased year-over-year, because again -- because of our super saver shipping adoption.  

And then our operating expenses were up. When I talked earlier about our technology and content being up $11 million year over year, and the things that we're doing with that, a very significant portion of that is in our North America segment. So again that is what is driving the operating expenses, again, to invest in our business.  

And then the first part of the question. We don't -- certainly from an operating margin standpoint we have said historically that our operating margin over the long-term, our goal was to either reach double digits or high single digit. But again our goal always has been, we want to maximize free cash flow for our shareholders. And that is what we're going to do. So we're going to optimize for free cash flow. We had we think very strong results in Q3. And over the past 12 months our free cash flow reached $420 million. Significant growth, up 76 percent year-over-year. That is what we're optimizing for. So we're making investments. We're making those great trade-offs we believe to optimize free cash flow over the long term.  

OPERATOR: Shawn Milne with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.  

SHAWN MILNE, ANALYST, FRIEDMAN, BILLINGS, RAMSEY: Tom, just a quick couple of questions on the operating cycle. Free cash flow numbers were pretty strong in the quarter. Just looking at some of the numbers here, the payable days went up. Was there something going on there? And we saw the inventory turns actually dip a little bit. Isn't that surprising given that the third party unit number continues to go up? If you could just add a little bit more around that?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. The first part of your question on payable days. Yes, sequentially our payable days went from 51 days to 57 days. If you look at last year you saw a similar increase. Not quite to the extent, because we had Harry Potter 5 and was launched in Q2 of last year. We didn't make the majority of the payments until Q3. But you saw an increase of 6 days sequentially this year. We saw an increase of approximately 5 days last year sequentially. Again, that is getting ready for the holiday season.  

In terms of the inventory in the existing categories we continue to add selection. We continue to make sure that we get our in-stock levels where we want them to be. Obviously we have launched quite a few new categories over the past 12 months. And we have -- with those we have also made sure that we had the right inventory on hand as well. So those are what is driving the two measurements. But as you had mentioned, our operating cycle is still very strong, still greater than 20 days. And again, you should expect that to be -- still continue to be part of our model.  

SHAWN MILNE: I'm not sure if I got the right number. Can you just repeat the third part of unit number?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, third-party units as a percentage of the total was 28 percent this quarter. That was a high for us. That is up from 22 percent in the third quarter of last year.  

OPERATOR: Heath Terry with Credit Suisse First Boston.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: You just mentioned that third-party has hit a record level. I'm curious if you could just kind of walk us through the strategy for third-party outside the U.S.? I am kind of surprised that we haven't seen more news around that. Obviously we saw that you have expanded into the toy category in Germany and Japan. Can you give us an idea of what the time frame and the roll out is going to look like as you get the international sites to look more like the U.S.?  

JEFF BEZOS: Third-party sales, of course internationally are already fairly strong in most of -- with the marketplace business. With Merchants@, that is something that is rolling out as we roll out the technology to do that around the world. So there is -- that is an opportunity that we will be pursuing. As far as the timing of that, I can't share that with you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Just to add on to that, as the Jeff had mentioned, our third-party sales in international are very strong. We also reached a record high in international as well.  

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: I had a couple of questions. I don't know if you talked about unit growth or not, but can you -- can you give us a sense of the unit growth looks like in the quarter?  

Secondly, and I am just trying to think about the search business in general. And do you think that there any -- what is the impact on your business should some of the search engines out there, like Yahoo and Google, change some of their algorithms around and continue to optimize, does that have any sort of impact on your business, especially when you consider, I guess, on the algorithmic search site and your ability to serve pages into the engines and being relevant out there? And also within your affiliate network?  

JEFF BEZOS: I'm not completely sure I understand the question. We do -- to the degree that the algorithms change we might get less traffic from algorithmic search, less or more. Amazon is well-positioned because such a large fraction of our traffic comes directly to Amazon.com. The associates program that we started 9 years ago has a very large number of associates in the program pointing to Amazon.com. Those associates are independent of search.  

TOM SZKUTAK: The other part of your question, unit growth was 30 percent for the quarter year-over-year.  

OPERATOR: Imran Khan with J.P. Morgan.  

DANA GREY, ANALYST, J.P. MORGAN: This is Dana Grey in for Imran. I'm just wondering if you can comment going into the holiday season on your inventory levels in the toys category? I know with the lawsuit with ToysRUs I'm not sure what the inventory levels are like, and how you're planning to compensate with any of your other vendors?  

JEFF BEZOS: The receiving and storage of inventory for the holiday, including toys is proceeding on schedule. And we're also in the process of supplementing our toy selection with merchandise from other sellers.  

OPERATOR: Paul Keung with CIBC.  

PAUL KEUNG, ANALYST, CIBC: Help me out here. Your CapEx went from 85 million, I believe you said, this year to 150. Can you explain again the reason for the increase? And is it a signal of a longer-term trend in terms of your CapEx spending?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Our CapEx in general is going to be very low for our business. We're not a capital intensive business. What you're seeing is for next year you'll continue to see more software engineers and computer scientists hired. So you should expect to see more capitalized software. With all the initiatives that we have going on from a technology standpoint, you should expect that storage capacity will be increasing. We will be using some of the CapEx for that.  

And then lastly, we will be, as always, trying to make sure that we have the best productivity in our fulfillment centers, so we will be using some of the CapEx for that as well.  

PAUL KEUNG: So the absolute level will stay at those -- I'm sorry the numbers will continue to increase on an absolute level, is that correct?  

TOM SZKUTAK: No, you shouldn't expect -- you should expect that over time our investment intensity to be low. You will have years that we will have a reinvestment ratio that will be above 1. You will have years that will be below 1. Where it settles in is difficult to say. But again, based on our model, we're not a heavy capital intensive business.  

PAUL KEUNG: And then I'm trying to reconcile some of the assumptions in my model here. When you talked about maximizing free cash flow, can you talk about when you go next year, as the levels we have seen sort of have indications of the type of hurdles you like to meet in terms of maximizing free cash flow growth on a LTM basis?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Good you repeat the last part of the question?  

PAUL KEUNG: Yes, we saw LTM free cash flow go up this quarter 76 percent. Correct?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes.  

PAUL KEUNG: Is that a --?  

TOM SZKUTAK: That is a trailing 12 --.  

PAUL KEUNG: It is trailing twelve-month level. If we looked at that number and the last couple of numbers, maybe the numbers implied the next couple of quarters. Is that a sort of a good indication of where you think the health of your business is?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm not sure I understand the question, but I will take a pass at it. I think certainly pro forma net increase is one driver of our cash flow, as well as our operating cycles kind of continue to be similar to what it is. As I mentioned earlier, we're going to do the right things to make sure that we do the right long-term things for our shareholders, which is continue to focus on adding selection on the categories that we in, continue to focus on adding new categories.  

We think there is opportunity to improve our seller platform, improve the customer experience. We think there's an opportunity in search, Web services. Those are things that we certainly have our top computer scientists and engineers on today. And we expect and hope to deliver free cash flow -- high levels of free cash flow over time with those investments.  

PAUL KEUNG: So essentially high double digits for the long-term?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Our stated goal is to reach triple digit returns on invested capital over time. And we're certainly making progress towards that goal.  

OPERATOR: Dan Geiman with McAdams Wright Ragen.  

DAN GEIMAN, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN: With respect to Joyo.com what is your strategy, and what are your opportunities with respect to this business? Are you going to be rolling out new products and services? And are there going to be any costs related to the operations?  

JEFF BEZOS: Over time we will roll out more categories, just as you have seen us do in other places in the world. It is a long-term strategy. It is still very early days for e-commerce in China. And there is a tremendous amount of long-term opportunity. And we're excited about being there in these early days.  

DAN GEIMAN: Any costs related to operations, say, in '05?  

TOM SZKUTAK: We're not giving out specific guidance on Joyo.com for 2005, but it is certainly incorporated in our guidance.  

OPERATOR: Bob Peck with Bear Stearns.  

VICTOR ANTHONY, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: This is Victor Anthony sitting in for Bob Peck. I just had a quick follow-up with regard to China. I just wanted to talk about your long-term strategies within that country. Do you plan to, I guess, implement the same sort of strategies you have in the U.S., in the European countries, such as free shipping, lower prices, developing a third party business over there over time in China? And could you talk about some of the challenges you would face implementing those strategies if you choose to do so?  

JEFF BEZOS: First of all, I believe they already have free shipping at Joyo.com. But basically the answer to your question is we will employ the same customer centric strategy in China that we employ everywhere in the world. And the three main drivers of that are selection, low prices, and convenience. So you can expect to see us pursue exactly that same set of important customer experience drivers in China over time.  

OPERATOR: Lanny Baker, Citigroup Smith Barney.  

LANNY BAKER, ANALYST, CITIGROUP SMITH BARNEY: Looking at the guidance that you have given out for next year, it strikes me that you have given revenue and operating income numbers, but not free cash. And yet it seems like in listening to you guys, you're trying to maximize around optimizing long-term free cash flow or current free cash flow, but free cash flow really seems to be the thing you have a penchant for.  

Is there a reason why you don't think it would be useful to sort of highlight free cash flow expectations that you hold for yourselves in '05? And sort of along those lines can you're help us just sort of tick off what the checklist of differences would be between, as you look right now -- look at your free cash flow relative to your operating income this year? And then sort of tick off what will be the differences that might affect that relationship between free cash flow and operating income in '05? I guess higher CapEx is one of them.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes, we haven't given -- we haven't given guidance on free cash flow for 2005. But certainly we have given you guidance on operating profit. We have given you guidance on capital expenditures. You can assume that certainly our operating cycle will remain similar over the years to come. So I think you have enough certainly to work with on that. Did that answer your question?  

LANNY BAKER: Yes, I guess so. So the relationship seems pretty constant, and you didn't guide to it just because you didn't guide to it. Is that fair enough?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yes.  

OPERATOR: We will take our final question from Safa Rashtchy.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST: Just trying to understand your cost structure next year, and to what degree these investments will pay off in the future year. You obviously have established a premier position in e-commerce worldwide, and very solid infrastructure. And you have been investing this year already heavily, which is why the operating margin margins have been taking a hit.  

I'm a little puzzled that next year the operating margins will further come down. I understand your comments in general, Jeff, that you're building more with computer scientists and infrastructure and so forth. But it if your goal is still to maintain -- to reach double-digit operating margin, certainly you're not going in the right direction by next year. And my question is when would we see a reversal of this decline? To what degree this is onetime buildup, or is it just much more expensive to sell online than you had originally assumed?  

JEFF BEZOS: I think it is really a -- what we're trying to do, and what we have been doing for the last few years is over time developing a better understanding of elasticity with respect to things like lower product prices. We're developing a better understanding of -- even inside product categories which subcategories respond more to price than others. It gives us the ability to get smarter on pricing.  

As we get smarter on pricing, able to -- and if we get more operational efficient so that we can afford to lower prices for customers -- both in the form of lower product prices and free shipping programs -- that allows us to maximize dollar operating income and dollar free cash flows, as opposed to optimizing percentage operating margins.  

And I think that is really the top-level point that we're trying to emphasize, is as we get smarter about our business, we going to try to do the right thing for driving absolute dollar numbers rather than percentage numbers. And the beneficiaries of that strategy are going to be our customers because it turns out that the best way in our business to maximize dollar numbers, absolute dollar numbers, is by lowering prices and offering free shipping, and basically taking our efficiencies as we can afford to do so and giving them back to customers. We are well positioned to do that.  

Many of our costs are relatively fixed. And because of the scale that we have in our business we are able to amortize those portions of our costs which are fixed across a very large customer base. So there's a big structural advantage for us there.  

TIM STONE: With that I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today, as well as for your questions. Somebody will be available on our Investor Relations Website, at least through the end of the quarter. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter, and appreciate your interest in Amazon.com. Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you.  

JEFF BEZOS: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com second-quarter 2004 financial results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tim Stone. Mr. Stone, please go ahead.  

   TD
TIM STONE, VP OF IR, AMAZON.COM: Good afternoon. Welcome to the Amazon.com second-quarter 2004 conference call. Joining us on today's call is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, will be available for Q&A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 22, 2004 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our 2003 annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen today's call, I encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well metrics and commentary on the quarter.  

During this call, we also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In the release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR Web site, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures to certain comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2003.  

With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM: Thanks, Tim. Today I will discuss our financial and operating results and our future expectations. This was another successful quarter for Amazon.com as we continued to execute on our strategy of low prices, broad selection and convenience to our customers.  

Let me start with a few comments on our financial results. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis grew 45 percent to $354 million driven by organic growth in revenues and operating profit. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 434 million shares, essentially flat with a year ago.  

On the income statement, revenue grew 26 percent, gross profit grew 25 percent, while gross margin decreased 32 basis points. Consolidated segment operating profit grew 50 percent, operating margin increased 116 basis points, and pro forma net income grew 77 percent. Revenue grew 26 percent to $1.39 billion or 22 percent after the $47 million favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange.  

We're pleased with this growth in the context of a very tough comparison with Q2 '03 when Harry Potter 5 was released. Our best estimate is that Harry Potter 5 and the accompanying purchases accounted for 5 points of incremental growth or more.  

Consolidated segment operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined 148 basis points. G&A increased primarily due to higher legal fees as we continued to vigorously defend legal matters. We expect absolute dollar spend and G&A to increase in Q3 and over time. We also expect technology and content costs to continue to grow in absolute dollars in Q3 and over time.  

We continue to be successful in hiring top computer scientists and software engineers on an accelerated basis. We believe this is the right thing to do for the customer experience and long-term shareholder value.  

In addition, we have started recruiting for our Development Centre in Scotland, which will open later this year. We have also chosen Scotland as the location for our second UK fulfillment center to meet growing demand in the UK. The leased facility is already occupied by some of our staff who are planning for shipments before the holidays and will employ approximately 300 over time. Consolidated segment operating income grew 50 percent to $101 million, and operating margin increased from 6.1 percent to 7.3 percent. Adjusting for the $4 million benefit from foreign exchange rates, operating income grew 44 percent. Trailing 12 month consolidating segment operating income, a component of free cash flow, was $444 million, up $180 million year-over-year including $18 million due to foreign exchange.  

In the North America segment, revenue grew 13 percent to $792 million. Media grew 9 percent and would have been substantially higher without the year-over-year compare of Harry Potter 5. EGM or electronics and other general merchandise revenue grew 27 percent to $226 million and represented 29 percent of North America revenue, up from 25 percent. Gross profit grew 16 percent, while gross margin increased from 27.1 percent to 27.7 percent. Operating income grew 21 percent, and operating margin expanded from 7.8 percent to 8.3 percent.  

In the international segment, revenue grew 50 percent to $595 million, representing 43 percent of worldwide sales. Revenue growth was 38 percent adjusting for the $46 million benefit from foreign exchange rates. Media revenue grew 35 percent and would have been substantially higher without the year ago compare of Harry Potter 5. EGM revenue grew 218 percent to $99 million and represented 17 percent of international revenue, up from 8 percent. Gross profit grew 45 percent, while gross margin was down from 21.1 percent to 20.4 percent as a result of our free shipping, product mix shift and price reductions.  

Operating income grew $22 million, reaching $35 million, and operating margin expanded from 3.2 percent to 5.9 percent. Pro forma net income increased to $75 million or 18 cents per diluted share compared with 10 cents per share. Our GAAP net income was $76 million or 18 cents per diluted share compared with a loss of $43 million or 11 cents per share.  

The net change of $120 million was primarily the result of the following. First, a $46 million improvement in the mark-to-market effect of remeasuring our Euro based debt to dollars, and a $44 million increase in operating income, 7 million of which was due to a gain recorded on previously vacated office space in conjunction with our 2001 restructuring which we determined during the quarter was necessary for our future needs. Though GAAP net income of $76 million is again higher than pro forma net income of 75, we still believe the pro forma number is an important and useful way to look at our business.  

Inventory was $284 million including the foreign exchange lift from inventories held outside the U.S.. Trailing 12 month inventory turns were 18 down from 20 as we bolstered our inventory to optimize in stock levels across our product categories, including newer categories such as jewelry. Our negative operating cycle was again over 20 days. Inventory again averaged 4 percent of annual sales.  

Our investment in fixed assets, which includes capitalized software development costs, declined 3 percent to $216 million. Capital expenditures were $14 million. Fixed assets plus inventory were $500 million, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of our total assets excluding cash and marketable securities. Cash and marketable securities increased from $989 million to $1.15 billion, including $46 million from favorable movements in foreign exchange rates.  

During the prior 12 months, we have redeemed $350 million in convertible debt that was otherwise due in 2009 mitigating nearly 4.5 million shares of potential dilution in addition to reducing our cash interest expense. Return on invested capital increased from 28 percent to 39 percent calculated using what we believe is a conservative approach to both return and invested capital, trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities. Our long-term expectation is to deliver triple-digit returns on invested capital.  

Our growth continues to be fueled our persistent focus on the total customer experience -- selection, price and convenience. We expanded selection across our sites worldwide. We launched beta versions of our beauty and musical instrument stores in the U.S. further leveraging our merchants at platform and building on the success of recent new product categories such as gourmet food, health and personal care and jewelry.  

Customer shopping at our beauty start can now find, discover and buy more than 20,000 products, such as lush bath bombs and (inaudible) from over 40 merchants including Avon, L'Occitane, N.V. Perricone and Sephora.  

Our musical instruments stores offers customers with more than 30,000 products, including popular and exotic instruments, sound and recording equipment, DJ gear and accessories from leading industry merchants such as Musicians Friend, Woodwinds & Brasswinds, and Music123.  

In stores and outdoors, we now have over 400 merchants, as well as unique product content selection available online only at Amazon.com, including Cal Ripken Jr.'s essay on the importance of practice, and the a Flybar 1200, a revolutionary new pogo stick stunt bar enables riders to clear over 5 feet. The Flybar is now available for pretty order exclusively at Amazon.com.  

In apparel we continue to add new merchants to our growing selection, including Boot Barn, Cutter & Buck, Elizabeth, G&L Clothing, J.C. Penney and Liz Claiborne. The apparel store now features over 300 merchants and 3000 brands. We have now launched over 4000 merchants at business sellers offering primarily new merchandise, up from over 350 less than a year ago.  

Units sold from third-parties represented 24 percent of worldwide unit sales, up from 19 percent. We plan to continue to expand selection in existing categories and opening and promoting new categories worldwide over the next year.  

We continue to lower prices for customers. Customer adoption of our worldwide free shipping offers reached another high point this quarter, saving customers tens of millions of dollars more this quarter. In the UK, for example, we continue to see increased adoption of free shipping as customers embrace the 25 pound threshold which was 39 pounds this time last year. And Japanese customers continue to enjoy free shipping on a very high percentage of their orders due to the low 1500 Yen purchase threshold or less than $15.  

Our Jewelry Store continues to attract customer interest featuring high-quality items at low prices, including margins targeted at about 13 percent on diamond jewelry. Our number one bestseller is a $29 potato pearl necklace and earrings set, which has received great customer reviews and is eligible for free Super Saver Shipping.  

Our worldwide customer service team achieved a greater than 20 percent year-to-year reduction in contacts per unit, enabling us to share the savings from self-service and more efficient customer contacts with customers in the form of lower prices.  

We continue to lower prices on thousands of media and EGM products this quarter, and we have improved selection of value-priced, closeout and refurbished products, especially in our electronics and home and garden stores. Free shipping offers, low prices in jewelry and closeout products are part of Amazon's everyday effort to lower prices, and we intend to further lower prices for customers in the second half of this year and thereafter. Our goal is to maximize gross profit dollars not percentages, ultimately maximizing free cash flow and free cash flow per share for our shareholders.  

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our Q3 '04 guidance and 2004 baseline expectations are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the Euro pound, Yen and Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events.  

While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Let me also remind everyone that since certain stock awards are subject to variable accounting, we incur a non-cash charge or gain for any movement in our share price between reporting dates. We mark our year denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a non-cash gain or loss for any movement in the Euro between reporting dates. We also have exposure to the Euro related to our unhedged interest expense on this Euro-denominated debt.  

We incur a non-cash foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies which are to be repaid among subsidiaries. We cannot forecast these items, yet they could have a significant positive or negative impact on our results.  

For the September quarter, we expect net sales between 1.425 billion and 1.525 billion or growth of between 26 and 34 percent compared with Q3 of '03. Consolidated segment operating income to be between $80 million and $100 million or grow between 9 and 36 percent. For the calendar year 2004, we expect net sales of between 6.625 billion and 6.925 billion or growth between 26 and 32 percent. Consolidated segment operating income to be between $475 million and $535 million or growth of between 31 and 48 percent. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be $80 million or less. When we think about growth, we're focused on long-term growth from free cash flow per share; that is ultimately how we will measure our success.  

Finally, we cannot predict fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. This guidance assumes foreign exchange rates to stay approximately where they have been recently. We're confident that if we continue to drive customer experience, execute efficiently against our many challenges and opportunities, and earn customer trust, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will further expand.  

Thanks and with that, Tim, let's move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Thanks, Tom. Let us move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, would you please remind our listeners how to ask a question?  

OPERATOR: (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Mark Mahaney, American Technology Research.  

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH: Here is the question. In terms of your September quarter guidance, the midpoint of your pro forma operating margin is about 6.1 percent, which is down 120 basis points quarter to quarter. What is the major driver there of that sequential decline given the gross margin trends of the quarter, given they are sequentially down sales and marketing numbers in the June quarter?  

The second question just really briefly, are you seeing any general trends in terms of consumer spending, and particularly a pullback in consumer spending either in the U.S. or internationally? Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of our guidance, there is three key reasons for our Q3 bottom guidance, things that we are going to be doing differently than we have. First of all, one thing that is a constant is we are going to continue to lower prices for customers in the Q3 in the second half.  

Second, as I mentioned in my comments, we expect that technology and content costs are going to continue to grow in absolute dollars. We will continue to be successful in recruiting top computer scientists and software engineers, and we think that is the right thing for our customers and for our shareholders over the long-term.  

And third, we've actually seen very strong growth in the UK, and we have announced that we're actually adding a second UK fulfillment center in Scotland. And we actually are leasing a facility today in Scotland. We have some staff in Scotland already preparing for the holidays. We will continue to staff that facility over the course of the quarter. Of course, with that, we will have the cost of that facility and the people in that facility, but we won't have a lot of throughput to that facility until either later in the quarter or into the fourth quarter. So that will certainly be a lag versus what we saw in second quarter. So again that is what is reflected certainly in our guidance, and we think it positions us very well for the future, and we are excited with the things that we're doing.  

OPERATOR: Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much. As we think about value in the Company and think about the long-term growth and profitability of the Company, we often look to incremental operating margin as the best leading indicator of that. And when the Company was going through its march to profitability, the incremental profitability of the Company on an operating income basis was in the midteens, and it was still in that level in 2003 until we got to the fourth quarter drop-down sub 10 percent. And since then, we have continued to see the deterioration and it has stayed in the 11 percent range through this quarter. And as we look at the third quarter, it is going to be in the single digits.  

And I just wonder if you think you're going to have to respend the amount of money and technology and marketing and R&D to stay competitive, that the incremental margin will not be in that range for the foreseeable future? And is that the key driver behind the spending?  

Secondly, could you give us some sense of the progress that you're making in your new categories? It seems that you have offered several new categories just domestically that we would see in the EGM line since the October time period, but we are not really seeing a pickup in growth. Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks. Our goal always is to maximize free cash flow over time, and to step back from that, in addition to that we are trying to maximize operating profit dollars over time. And what you're seeing clearly in Q3 as I mentioned to Mark in the previous question, is we're making sure we're doing the right things going forward. Again, continuing to lower prices, continuing to make sure we have the best talent from a software engineering computer science standpoint, and again we accelerated hiring, which is impacting Q2 -- excuse me, Q3 guidance. And again, those are things that we certainly want -- they are the seeds we are planning for the future and we think will help improve the overall customer experience going forward.  

And then lastly again, I mentioned Scotland as well. That is one that's more of a temporary drag on Q3, and again once that is operational, you will see a lot of throughput to it.  

So again looking forward you know we're very optimistic about the model that we have and the opportunities we have in front of us. And when we see good opportunities to invest like we're doing, we are going to continue to do the right thing for our long-term shareholders.  

And the second part of your question, Anthony, I am sorry?  

ANTHONY NOTO: I was just wondering if you would give us some type of granularity on the progress of all the new stores that you have launched since October. You know obviously that is reported in a lot of different lines. We sort of look to the North American EGM line as a potential proxy for that, and the growth is there slowing. And you did not have those businesses a year ago in the convertible second quarter, and they been open for three-quarters. I was just wondering is there some slower traction in those businesses, less awareness, less supply that or selection that is appealing to drop conversion rates? What is the underlying trend in the business, and how should we think about it? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Anthony, the new categories are growing very rapidly. Their impact on the growth rate of the company as a whole is small because the baseline off of which they are growing is still small, although getting larger all the time.  

OPERATOR: Heath Terry, Credit Suisse First Boston.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: I was wondering if you could give us an idea abut the planned rollout for the third-party business in Europe, particularly how you plan to approach signing partners there, like the partners here that you have got with Circuit and Target and the rest? And to the extent that you have started this process, what kind of a reaction you're getting in Europe and how it might be different from the reaction that you got from partners here in the U.S.?  

TOM SZKUTAK: We don't see any structural differences or any substantial differences between the United States and Europe in that regard, and we think we will have over time the same kind of success, at least we hope we will, in Europe that we have had in the U.S..  

HEATH TERRY: And is there any timeline that you can put around that for when we should start seeing that develop?  

TOM SZKUTAK: No, I would not want to speculate on specific timeline, but it is something we are working toward.  

OPERATOR: Imran Khan, J.P. Morgan.  

IMRAN KHAN, ANALYST, J.P. MORGAN: As electronic products became a bigger portion of your total revenue and it seems like those products have lower gross margin, how are you going to manage your gross margin as those products become a bigger portion of your revenue?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I'm wanting to keep in mind, you would certainly add to this, is that the gross -- what we are really focused on is the gross profit dollars in those items. And in many cases, the gross profit dollars are actually much higher than we're accustomed to dealing with. So you take a $300 digital camera with a 13 percent gross margin, and it still has a very healthy number of gross profit dollars in it, and that's what really matters to us.  

IMRAN KHAN: Thanks.  

OPERATOR: Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: Thank you, Tom Jeff. The growth in the U.S. media segment slowed down significantly to 9 percent from 16 percent last quarter, and it has been pretty much around 14 to 16 percent up until last quarter. That is the single biggest segment of your revenues. Could you talk about what factors contributed to that pretty significant decline in growth, and what makes you optimistic about continuing growth given that the bulk of the revenues are actually declining?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of media in North America, as you know, we had Harry Potter 5 release last year, and so it was certainly significant for us.  

SAFA RASHTCHY: But even if you said it was 5 percentage points, even without that, it was a noticeable sequential decline.  

TOM SZKUTAK: I said it was -- I had mentioned in my comments it was 5 incremental points or more globally, so on our total company.  

SAFA RASHTCHY: Okay, and may I have a follow-up on that please?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure.  

SAFA RASHTCHY: Actually not on the revenue line, but I wanted to just make sure I understood your comments about the reason for increased spending in R&D in particular. I'm not sure if I am understanding what is the use of the increased resources. You mentioned that you have access to very good talent, and I'm sure that's not the only reason to hire them. Could you talk about given that you have pretty substantial operating expenses already and very good infrastructure how would you be deploying these new resources and why are you hiring them?  

TOM SZKUTAK: It is a good question. There are a number of things that we are working on that you will see deployed over time. I don't want to talk about the things we will do in the future, but if you look in the recent past, the kinds of things that you see are things like "Search Inside the Book," which has been very successful for books category. And there are a number of very complicated but effective software projects that can be done on both the front-end and the back-end to make our business better for customers and shareholders.  

SAFA RASHTCHY: Thank you.  

OPERATOR: Lanny Baker, Smith Barney.  

LANNY BAKER, ANALYST, SMITH BARNEY: Thanks a lot. A pretty simple question. On the revenue in North America and the investments that you're making, it looks like they are against the margins right now. How long is the cycle of hiring people and working on the product technology? How long do you make the investment stock price margin before it slingshots back the other way potentially?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Most of the technology projects that have fairly short timelines or a least we get incremental results fairly quickly so we don't work on things for a long time before launching anything. If they are customer facing things, then once you do launch it, then it generally takes quite a bit of time for something to build into a substantial business, sort of like a new category. You launched it. The customers who use it like it. It grows very rapidly, but it grows off of a small initial base. So it takes time before these things effect the performance of the company as a whole.  

LANNY BAKER: Okay. So is it -- I guess in some total then on the investments that you're making right now, are we talking about is it a six-month period that the Company is in of heavier investments and heavier spending or is it 12?  

TOM SZKUTAK: I think it's very difficult to say in the abstract without talking about the specific investment because there are a variety of investments, some of which have very short payback horizons and some of which have somewhat longer payback horizons. But certainly a number of the things -- most of the things that we do today affect our results a couple of years from now. I am speaking in general.  

OPERATOR: Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank Securities.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: A couple of questions. Can you talk a little more about I guess the search market and related products that you have in that kind of segment of the market? And does it allow you to basically rev the model faster in terms of understanding what the consumer buying behavior looks like, where maybe demand is shifting towards? Is it allowing you to roll out categories even faster because of what you're learning in the search industry with the products that you have out there today like A9?  

And second, can you just talk about what you see in Germany in particular given the weak economy out there? Are you kind of seeing a little bit more of a seasonal trend in that marketplace today given a lot of the talk about Germany?  

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER & CEO, AMAZON.COM: On the first question -- I will let Tom answer the second piece -- but on the first question, certainly all of the activities that we do we learn from. A9.com in particular is focused on two things. One is improving e-commerce search for Amazon.com and our partners. That is something we have been working on for nine years, and we are just going to keep working on it.  

The second thing that that team does is have a consumer facing Web site at A9.com, which you could certainly go and check. And yes, there may be interesting data that comes out of that, although that is not the primary motivation for doing it. And then Tom?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of individual countries, we have not in the past given any specific results. We certainly have a very strong business in Germany. We have built a very strong business in Germany. And in terms of the total segment, international segment is up 50 percent. (inaudible) exchange is up 38, and certainly was impacted year-over-year with the difficult compare with Harry Potter 5. But again beyond that, we are not giving you any specific country results.  

JEETIL PATEL: Can you just talk about what your (inaudible) looked like in the quarter?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Globally it was 26 percent.  

OPERATOR: Mark Rowen, Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL: Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, if I look at your international media products, I am estimating that in local currency that grew at about 25 percent give or take, and that is a pretty steep deceleration of growth from the last three quarters. I might be wrong, but I don't think you could explain all of it with Harry Potter. So could you explain what is going on in international media products?  

And then second, there was a question earlier which I don't think you asked on the consumer pullback, we have seen consumers pulling back in a lot of sectors of retail, home furnishings, office supplies even. Are you seeing that on your site in June or in July?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of international media, we do certainly have a sizable impact from the year-over-year comparison of Harry Potter 5. It certainly impacted not only our North America segment, but our international segment. And then in terms of your question based on the economy, I don't think we are necessarily a bellwether for the economy. So in terms of the online penetration for retail sales, it is very small, and we are just not a bellwether for the economy.  

MARK ROWEN: So, Tom, are you saying the entire deceleration in international media products is due to Harry Potter? Did I understand that right?  

TOM SZKUTAK: It is actually hard to know. We certainly know what our sales were of Harry Potter 5 last year in the accompanying attachments, but certainly we had very positive traffic. So it's hard to tell.  

OPERATOR: Bob Peck, Bear Stearns.  

BOB PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: I have two larger picture questions. One is I guess as far as expansion, further international expansion. Could you talk about maybe some timing, when we could see new countries rolled out, and what the impact of that would be?  

Number two is, could you give a little more color around the competitive landscape? One particular example that comes to mind would be jewelry versus something like Blue Nile. Is competition intensifying? Is that why prices are coming down? Do you see barriers to entry? Can you just give us more comments on the competitive landscape that would be great. Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of international expansion, we like the countries and the Web sites we are in today. Certainly you should expect that we will expand into new countries over time In terms of timing of that, we certainly would not disclose that until we were ready to do so. But again you should expect that we will expand into new countries over time.  

In terms of competition, we don't really like to talk about any specific competitors. That being said, we certainly look on a category by category basis how our pricing is compared to our various competitors to make sure that we have very competitive prices in all the categories that we are in.  

OPERATOR: Sean Young, Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.  

SEAN YOUNG, ANALYST, FRIEDMAN, BILLINGS, RAMSEY: Thank you, Tom and Jeff. I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about your marketing going forward and in the quarter and specifically online advertising costs? You knew going into the quarter what your Harry Potter 5 units were, but it still seems like the revenue was at the low end of the range. Is there something that you saw in the marketing channel that caused you to dial back marketing during the quarter? Because the dollar number was a little bit below what I was expecting. Maybe, Jeff, if you have any thoughts on how you see that market developing in the next 6 to 12 months? Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Just briefly I think our marketing as a percentage of sales has stayed relatively flat. We are pretty happy with where it is. Our best use of marketing dollars we believe, given what we know about price elasticities, is to first we look to reduce product prices, do things like free Super Saver Shipping. Basically take the dollars that would have been spent on advertising and put those instead into improving the customer experience.  

Then second, we have certain kinds of advertising that we can do that are measurable. A large component of that is our associates program. That is a very effective program for us. We continue to do that. But I think our marketing dollars are pretty flat as a percentage of sales, and I think they are about where we want them.  

OPERATOR: Douglas Anmuth, Lehman Brothers.  

DOUGLAS ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Thank you. You reiterated today your commitment to free shipping. I am curious how you view free shipping? You have obviously stated in the past that it takes time for new initiatives to be absorbed throughout the customer base. So as a result, perhaps it takes longer really more than a year for free shipping to be absorbed and utilized. Even though we've already cycled through more than a year of free shipping obviously here in the United States, I'm wondering if you believe the Company is still benefiting from this initial adoption within the customer base, where do you think the user base is in the process in the U.S. and both internationally, and do you think it is continuing to help drive results the same way it was a few years ago or few quarters ago I am sorry, and whether you think that this is going to be an impact on North America media results in the coming quarters as you are looking to reaccelerate that growth level? Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: I think there is still benefit to come from the free Super Saver Shipping offer. It takes a long time for a message to become really internalized in the minds of millions of consumers. And some evidence for that is the fact that we set another record this quarter for adoption of Super Saver Shipping. We expect customers to continue to learn about that and utilize it.  

TIM STONE: With that, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. A replay will be available on Investor Relations Web site at least through the end of the quarter. I look forward to talking with you again next quarter, and thank you for your interest in Amazon.com. Good-bye.

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com first quarter 2004 financial results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tim Stone. Please go ahead, sir.  

TIM STONE, VP IR, AMZN: Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome to the Amazon.com first quarter 2004 conference call. Joining me on today's call is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our Founder and CEO, will be available for the question and answer portion of the call.  

   TD
Please keep in mind, the following discussion and responses of your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 22, 2004 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and all subsequent filings.  

As you listen to today's call, I encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes all of our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. It will correspond with much of the discussion that follows. During this call we also present certain non-GAAP financial measures. In the release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against the results for the comparable period of 2003. With that I'll turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMZN: Thanks Tim. Today I'll discuss our financial and operating results and our future expectations. This was a great quarter for Amazon.com thanks to customers who continue to take advantage of our lower prices, free shipping and expanded selection.  

Let me start with a few comments on our financial results. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis grew $221m, or 180%, to $344m, driven by improvements in top line growth and operating profit. The combination of common stock outstanding and stock-base awards was 432m shares, flat with a year ago.  

On the income statement, revenue grew 41%, gross profit grew 33%, while gross margin declined 139 basis points. Consolidated segment operating profit grew 73%, operating margin increased 142 basis points and pro forma net income grew $57m, or 141%.  

Revenue grew to $1.53b and for the first time, half of our revenue was from shipment to customers in over 200 countries outside the US. Adjusting for the $87m favorable year over year impact from foreign exchange rates, revenue growth was 33%.  

Consolidated segment operating expenses as a percentage of sales, declined 282 basis points. G&A increased primarily due to higher legal fees. We continue to vigorously defend legal matters and accordingly, this year we expect G&A costs to increase in absolute dollars, but not as a percentage of sales.  

Consolidated segment operating income grew 73% to $117m and the operating margin increased 142 basis points to 7.6%. Adjusting for the $7m benefit from foreign exchange rates, our operating income grew 64%. Trailing 12-month operating income of $411m, a component of free cash flow, benefited by $17m from foreign exchange rates.  

In the North America segment, revenue grew 20%, to $847m. Media revenue grew 16%. EGM, or electronics and other general merchandise revenue grew 33% and represented 27% of North America revenue.  

Gross profit grew 21%, while gross margins increased slightly to 26.7%, and operating income grew 46% as margin expanded 159 basis points to 8.9%.  

In the international segment, revenue grew 80%, to $684m. Revenue growth was 58%, adjusting for the $85m benefit from foreign exchange rate. Media revenue grew 62%. EGM revenue increased more than four times, from $23m to $107m. Gross profit grew 61%, while gross margin was 19.7%, down 236 basis points as a result of our free shipping, product mix shift and price reductions.  

In the UK for example, in addition to lowering book prices in the first quarter, we continue to see increased adoption of free shipping. We offered free shipping on orders over 39 pounds for roughly two-thirds of the first quarter of 2003 and since July of 2003 have offered free shipping on orders over 25 pounds. Additionally, the mix of EGM grew to 16% of international revenue, up from 6% of revenue, as we're offering low prices across our expanding selection as we grow these stores similar to our US approach. Over time we expect to increase selection in these stores with more third party sellers as well.  

International operating income grew over $25m, reaching $41m as margin expanded 190 basis points to 6.1%. Pro forma net income more than doubled, to $97m, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with $0.10 per diluted share.  

Our GAAP net income was $111m, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $10m, or $0.03 per share. The net change was primarily the result of the following; the $71m increase in operating income, 20m of which was associated with the decline in stock-based compensation and a $46m improvement in the mark to market effect of re-measuring our Euro-based debt to dollars. Though it was lower than the $111m GAAP net income number, we believe the $97m pro forma net income number is an important and useful way to look at our business.  

Inventory was $282m, including the foreign exchange impact from inventories held from outside the US. Inventory, again, averaged 4% of annual sales as we continue to bolster our inventory levels to optimize 2004 worldwide in stock levels across our product categories, including our newer ones, such as jewelry.  

The trailing 12-month inventory churns were 19, down from 20, and our negative operating cycle was again over 20-days. Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, declined 5% from a year ago, to $217m. Capital expenditures were $10m.  

Cash and marketable securities decreased to $998m, including $68m from favorable movement in foreign exchange rates. During the quarter we repaid $150m of US dollar convertible debt that was otherwise due in 2009, eliminating some potential share dilution, in addition to reducing our future net cash interest expense.  

Return on invested capital increased to 38%, up from 15%, calculating using what we believe is a conservative approach to both return and invested capital, trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities.  

Our growth continues to be fueled by our focus on every customer facing aspect of our business, from our product prices to our selection, from our Webster's user interface to how we package and ship items. The customer experience we create is by far the most important driver of our business.  

I'll now share some of our recent progress for each of the primary inputs into customer experience, selection, convenience and price. We expanded selection across product categories worldwide. As we enter the peak season for sports and outdoors, we now offer more than 200,000 items from over 250 Amazon services merchants. Since we introduced the store, over 350,000 customers have purchased products from our merchants. We've added over 125 merchants, including And 1 basketball gear, Bike Nashpar, Curly's Fishing Lures, The Official NHL Store, Paintball Stuff For Less, and many more across 50 sports and outdoor activities.  

In keeping with our customers' New Year's resolutions during Q1, we sold over 14,000 Bowflexes, treadmills, ab trainers, stop watches, pedometers and other exercise equipment and accessories.  

In apparel, we added several leading retailers and brands, including JLo by Jennifer Lopez, Lucky Brand Jeans, mahanuala, by Puma and Christy Turlington Burns, Samsonite and Teva Sport sandals. We now have over 200 Amazon services merchants in our apparel store, offering more than 2,000 brands, featuring over 150,000 clothing styles, with more than 1m color and size combinations. Since launch, more than 1m customer accounts have ordered an apparel item.  

We launched four new international stores; home and garden stores in Germany, do it yourself in tools in the UK, garden and outdoors stores in the UK and PCs in Japan. Active seller accounts, those with an order from one of our customers in the last 12-months, increased over 50%, to more than 700,000, including more than 2,000 merchant [at] business sellers offering primarily new merchandise.  

We plan to expand selection in existing categories and open and promote new categories worldwide over the next year. We constantly strive to make our stores more convenient for customers. We introduced guaranteed accelerated delivery, offering our US customers guaranteed next business day delivery on hundreds of thousands of products ordered from Monday through Thursday morning. Now customers who just can't wait for that new book, DVD, digital camera or other product can have it on their doorsteps the next day. And this service is guaranteed we'll get it to you the next business day or the shipping is on us. To see if your item is eligible, just look below the availability information on a product detail page.  

This morning, for example, when I went on the site at 8:14 a.m., the product detail page for the Six Sigma Way indicated, Want it delivered Friday, April 23rd? Order it in the next three hours and 16 minutes and choose one-day shipping at checkout.  

Again this year the widely followed American Customer Satisfaction Index gave Amazon.com a score of 88, the highest customer satisfaction score ever recorded in any service industry online or off.  

We'll grow our technology teams again in 2004 as we hire computer scientists and software engineers to invest in long-term innovation for customers. For the first time since 2000, annual technology and content costs are expected to grow in absolute dollars this year, although remain flat or decline as a percentage of revenue.  

And we strive to offer the lowest prices. Our pricing objective is not to discount a small number of products for a limited period of time, but to offer low prices everyday and apply them broadly across our entire product range. Recent examples include customer adoption of our worldwide free shipping offers reached the highpoint this quarter, saving customers tens of millions of dollars and bolstering our result to keep our free shipping offers in place indefinitely.  

We offered low prices in Canada. We lowered book prices in Canada by offering 30% off books over $25. Previously we offered 30% off books over $30. In both media and EGM we lowered prices on thousands of products again last quarter. In the UK we further reduced book prices by offering 30% off books over 10 pounds. Previously we offered 30% off books over 15 pounds.  

Our pricing strategy does not attempt to maximize margin percentages, but instead seeks to drive maximum value for customers and thereby create a much larger bottom line in the long-term. For example, as we discuss in more detail in a letter from Jeff on our homepage today, we're targeting gross margins on our jewelry sales to be substantially lower than industry norms, because we believe over time customers figure these things out. This approach will produce more value to shareholders.  

I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our Q2 '04 guidance and 2004 baseline expectations, are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the Euro pound, yen and Canadian dollar foreign exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events.  

While we are cautiously optimistic, it's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Let me also remind everyone that since certain stock awards are subject to variable accounting, we incur non-cash charge or gain for any movement in our share price between reporting dates. We mark our Euro denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a non-cash gain or loss for any movement in the Euro between reporting dates. We also have exposure to the Euro related to our un-hedged interest expense on this Euro denominated debt.  

We incur non-cash foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with inter-company balances denominated in foreign currencies, which are to be repaid amongst subsidiaries. We cannot forecast these items, yet they could have a significant impact, either positively or negatively on our results. For the June quarter we expect net sales of between $1.34b and $1.44b, or growth of between 22 and 31%, compared with Q2 of '03, when we shipped over 1.4m copies of Harry Potter V worldwide. Consolidated segment operating income to be between $85m and $105m, or growth between 27 and 56%.  

For the calendar year 2004 our expectations are net sales of between $6.45b and $6.85b, or growth of between 23 and 30%. Consolidated segment operating income to be between $455m and $535m, a growth of between 26 and 48%. While we expect to generate year over year growth, we will also continue to invest in our long-term opportunities. When thinking about growth we're focused on long-term growth and free cash flow. That's ultimately how we'll measure our success.  

We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $80m or less. And finally, we cannot predict fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates stay approximately where they've been recently.  

We are confident that if we continue to drive customer experience, execute efficiently against our many challenges and opportunities and earn customer trust, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will further expand, leading to triple-digit returns on invested capital.  

Thanks and with that, Tim, let's move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Great. Thanks Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to ask a question?  

OPERATOR: If you would like to ask a question at this time, please signal us by pressing the star key, followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. If you are using a speakerphone, please be sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. As a reminder, in the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to asking one question. Once again, please press star one to ask a question at this time.  

And we'll take our first question from Jeetil Patel, with Deutsche Bank Securities.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Hey guys. I have a couple of housekeeping questions. Can you talk about user and unit growth and how that trended in the quarter? Second, can you just talk about North America EGM? Growth actually accelerated. How much of an impact did some of your newer categories have in that line item? And then if you look at the calculation, it was something like $1.40 in operating profit, I believe, per unit. Where do you think that is going to settle out longer-term, as you scale up the business from a volume standpoint and among some of these newer categories?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, thanks Jeetil. In terms of unit growth, our unit growth for the quarter was greater than 36%. In terms of our growth in North America EGM, it was certainly driven by a number of things that we've done from a customer experience standpoint. Certainly lower prices - we lowered prices across many items during the quarter, excuse me, across many products during the quarter. We also improved in stock levels significantly as well. So those are certainly the key drivers that led to that growth as well as obviously the new categories that we've launched recently.  

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Brian Pitz, with Morgan Stanley.  

BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hey guys. A quick question on your A9 business. Obviously you rolled it out recently. Can you talk about what type of expense that's impacting in the expense line? And also your longer term plans for that? Because it does look like a great product. Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS, FOUNDER, CEO, AMZN: This is Jeff. The expense there is very much related to the number of people that are working on it. And there are a couple of different things going on there. They're working on eCommerce search, which is the eCommerce search engine that Amazon uses and that we offer to our partners. They've launched a consumer website, A9.com that has a few unique features. It integrates the search inside the book results. It has a personalized search history, so in the Amazon.com sort of way, it greets you by name, remembers your search history. And then there's a tool bar that has a persistent server side diary feature. So that's what A9 is working on.  

BRIAN PITZ: Okay. And just a follow-up on another topic regarding the foreign exchange. What have you guys been assuming for the Euro currency and some of the other currencies? And how much above your expectation was this quarter, versus what you were estimating? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Your question was related to Q1?  

BRIAN PITZ: Yes.  

TOM SZKUTAK: It certainly exceeded our expectations. We haven't disclosed the exact rate from an assumption standpoint, that we used, but it certainly exceeded our expectations.  

BRIAN PITZ: Okay, thank you.  

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Anthony Noto, with Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much. Jeff, in the past you've talked about your strategy of driving down cost to lower prices and that this would create demand. And that's been very successful in the categories where you've owned inventory, such as books, music and video. And then your announcement today with jewelry is very much aligned with that.  

Could you talk about how you can apply that strategy to sporting goods and apparel where I believe Amazon owns very little inventory, and how do you really differentiate that versus your competitive set? And if you do start to take inventory, what's the implications for fulfillment capacity? And are these categories where you're going to have to do more broad scale marketing? Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS: Most of the categories that we're in are hybrid categories in one way or another. And of course, even if you took a category like books, where we own a lot of inventory, the third parties who also sell books on our website are often able to offer a lot of value with respect to price. So I wouldn't characterize it as that the owned inventory is required to drive a low price strategy. We have several excellent partners in various categories, including electronics and so on and so on, who are often able to offer excellent value to customers. And we value those partner relationships.  

At the same time, we are, in our owned inventory business, going to be relentlessly focused on lowering prices, giving back value to customers and driving growth in our business that way. That's something we've been doing for several years now and we believe that strategy is working.  

ANTHONY NOTO: If I could just follow-up with one additional question on that. If you look at the marginal profitability on a year over year basis, the incremental operating margin, which we think is the best proxy for long-term margins, is around 11%, versus 18% last year. And I know that you've been giving back value to the consumer through free shipping and lower prices. But this is the first time in addition to that, that we've seen marketing up double-digits in 13 quarters. Do you think you have to continue to drive that marketing line going forward? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. We're going to continue to do the things that we think are right to help drive growth in the business. As you mentioned, our marketing spend was up. And again, that was online marketing that we're doing to drive traffic to our website, which we thought was pretty effective and we're going to continue trying to do more of the same.  

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Lanny Baker, with Citigroup Smith Barney.  

LANNY BAKER, ANALYST, CITIGROUP SMITH BARNEY: Thanks a lot. I have two questions. One's just a definition. Tom, could you go over again how you're calculating the return on invested capital number that you come up with? And then the second question is, of the 2,000 merchants I think that you said were merchants at Amazon.com. how many of those are selling on non-US Amazon sites? I imagine it's a pretty small number. What's the timeframe or what's the plan, what are the impediments at the moment from not making that a bigger number of third parties selling overseas?  

TOM SZKUTAK: The first part of your question, return on invested capital, we're using trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets, minus current liabilities. And can you just repeat the second half of the question related to third parties? I didn't get the full--.  

LANNY BAKER: Sure. I think that you had said that there were about 2,000 merchants at Amazon. Is that about right? And I was wondering if you could tell us how many of those are selling on Amazon's overseas properties and is there a plan to make that a - my sense is that it's a relatively small portion of them and is there a plan to make the third party selling bigger and what might be the timing of that and what are the challenges or the impediments to getting that done?  

TOM SZKUTAK: The way we are thinking about it is certainly as we enter new categories in all of our geographies, in many cases we start off with Amazon owned inventory first, in the case of EGM within international. And then over time as we increase our volume in those particular categories, we'll continue to attract more third party sellers. So again, it's part of everything that we do. So again, we expect that we'll continue to grow those as we go.  

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Heath Terry, with Credit Suisse First Boston.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: Great, thanks for that. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about strategy - and this may follow-up a little bit on the last question, but strategy as it goes towards signing up new third party partners outside of the US, particularly in Europe? And more specifically, realizing it's something that you do want to do, what barriers you expect to run into as you start to sign up those partners?  

JEFF BEZOS: What we've found so far is that there have not been substantial differences in the way we operate as we do things in different countries. So I would expect that we would find that that will be a very similar situation to what we found here.  

HEATH TERRY: Okay, thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Jeetil, I think we missed the first part or one of the parts of your question. You had asked about active customer accounts. That was 41m, up 26%.  

OPERATOR: And we'll move next to Robert Peck, with Bear Stearns.  

ROBERT PECK, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Yes, I have a quick three questions. Could you give us any thoughts on your plans for paying down more debt during the year? Could you also talk to us a little bit about where you are seeing increased competition coming from at the other online sites, who more particularly may be giving you more pressure than the others? And lastly, could you also comment on Amazon France and what exactly happened there with the local authorities in terms of the current situation over there?  

JEFF BEZOS: The first one on the debt, we did announce at the last call that we're retiring 150m of debt, which we did. We also announced that we'd be retiring up to $500m over time. And so that's all that we've announced to date. From a competitive environment standpoint, certainly we spend a lot of time focused on the customer and trying to improve the customer experience and that's where we spend our time. We certainly do look at individual competitors or other companies that are out there and trying to see what they do well and trying to learn from that. But again, we're a very customer focused company.  

The last question I think was on France, if I heard that correctly. Certainly we don't make it a practice to comment on any regulatory matters outside of our public filings.  

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Mark Rowen, with Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL EQUITY GROUP: Thanks. Two quick questions. One, I didn't notice in the release, can you tell us what percentage of units came from third party sales in the quarter? I think you've disclosed that in the past. And then second, as I look at your international media product sales, that business is almost as big as your North American media business, granted with some currency benefit. But it's growing at a significantly faster rate than the North American business and has been for a while now. Can that continue through the rest of the year and into next year? And if so, given the fact that it's about the same size now, why is it growing so much faster? Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS: In terms of third party units, our third party units as a percentage of the total was 23%, which is up from 19% from Q1 of last year. And in terms of media growth, we certainly have seen very strong growth in both international as well as North America media growth. And we're certainly not giving guidance for the year in those particular categories, but again, we're focused on the inputs that help us drive growth in both of those geographies, meaning in our international segment as well as North America. And we're continuously looking at ways to improve the total customer experience to do that.  

MARK ROWEN: But do you think that the market opportunity for the international media business is significantly bigger than the US?  

JEFF BEZOS: It's very difficult to know in advance. There certainly are some very nice things about some of the geographies in which we operate in, very rapid delivery times in some cases, for example. Sometimes there are reasons why big box stores don't work especially well in certain geographies due to zoning restrictions, et cetera, et cetera. So, there are some very nice characteristics and I think we'll just have to wait and see.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay great, thank you.  

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth, with Lehman Brothers.  

DOUG ANMUTH, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Thank you. If I look at the guidance that you put out and compare it to what we saw at the last quarter, it looks like you raised the top line and the consolidated operating income both by about 3.1%, which kind of gets us to a 7.44% margin, which would be just about the same as it was last quarter. I'm just wondering if there's any particular reason why we might not see more operating leverage in that number?  

And then also, just speaking about the North America media business, which also came in very strong again for the quarter, I'm just wondering how you see that playing out against some tougher comparisons over the next couple of quarters and how recent strength in music sales might also be impacting the business? Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of guidance for the total year, we did raise guidance. Last quarter we had said that guidance for the year, for the top line would be between $6.2b and $6.7b and we raised that to 64.5 to 68.50. Again, I'm reflecting the optimism that we have for the year. Certainly in terms of your question on operating leverage, we continue to focus on the right things, which are again, how do we make the improvements in customer experience to drive growth?  

From an operating leverage standpoint, what that means is that we're going to continue to make sure that we continue to hire software development engineers. So you should expect that technology and content, for example, will continue to grow through the course of the year. But again, we're focused on balancing that with maximizing operating profit dollars and free cash flow over the course of the year.  

And I'm sorry, the other part of the question related to media?  

DOUG ANMUTH: The North America media business, which was obviously very strong, how it might stack up going forward against some tougher comparisons? And then also how much music contributed, given that it's been stronger the last several months, a few months at least?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, we've certainly seen very solid growth in media. We're not giving guidance specifically on media. Certainly for Q2 as you look at our guidance, just keep in mind that that has a tough compare to last year with us selling over 1.4m copies of Harry Potter V.  

DOUG ANMUTH: And on the music, or you have no comment on that? I mean if you've seen a boost there kind of commensurate with the overall market?  

TOM SZKUTAK: We actually have not broken individual subcategories out.  

DOUG ANMUTH: Okay great. Thank you.  

OPERATOR: And we'll take our final question from Mark Mahaney, with American Technology Research.  

MARK MAHANEY, ANALYST, AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH: Great thank you. Two quick questions. One on the guidance for the June quarter. The midpoint of your guidance implies 9% sequential decline. That seems greater than the seasonality you've seen not last year, but two years ago. So just any more color on why your guidance is like that?  

And secondly, I know you don't run the business off of gross margins, but there is this significant gap between US and international gross margins. It's approximately 690 basis points in this last quarter. Could you talk about two or three levers you have that could reduce those margins and specifically bring up the international gross margins to US levels? Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. First in terms of the sequential decline from a revenue standpoint from Q1 to Q2, first a couple of reminders. The first one is in Q1 we had a significant benefit from foreign exchange rates in Q1. Q1 revenue was helped by $87m from foreign exchange rates. And certainly the dollar has strengthened in the recent months, so you should assume that there's certainly a meaningful benefit in Q2 guidance, but not as significant. And obviously the second major driver would be, obviously, with comparing Q2 we have a tough compare, as I mentioned before, because of Harry Potter V last year selling over 1.4m copies, and obviously the associated traffic with that as well.  

MARK MAHANEY: And on the gross margin opportunity?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. On the gross margin opportunity I think we're certainly at two different stages between North America and international. Some of our categories are certainly just much newer. For example, you can see within international, our EGM growth was very significant during the quarter, roughly four times the absolute amount in terms of growth during the quarter. So again, we just have very different stages.  

And so as we grow we'll continue to do the right thing to make sure the customers have the best possible pricing. But we'll also be able to get better scale, which means we'll be able to get better prices with suppliers. In turn we'll also be able to attract more third party sellers. So all of those things will help that over time.  

MARK MAHANEY: Thank you.  

TIM STONE: Okay, thanks Mark. With that I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our call today. A replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter and thank you again for your interest in Amazon.com.

OPERATOR: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Fourth Quarter 2003 Financial Results conference call. Todayâ€™s call is being recorded.  

For opening remarks and introductions Iâ€™d like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tim Stone. Please go ahead, sir.  

   TD
TIM STONE, VP OF IR, AMZN: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Amazon.com Fourth Quarter 2003 conference call. Joining on todayâ€™s call will be Tom Szkutak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jeff Bezos, our CEO, will be available for the question and answer portion of the call.  

Please keep in mind that the following discussion and responses to your questions reflect managementâ€™s views as of today, January 27th, 2004 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.  

Additional information about factors that could potentially affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and also the SEC filings.  

As you listen to todayâ€™s call I encourage you to have our press release in front of you since all of our financial results as well as the metrics and commentary on the quarter are included and will correspond to much of the discussion that follows.  

During this call we will also present certain non-GAAP financial measures. In the release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC each of which is posted on our IR web site, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. And finally, unless otherwise stated all comparisons used in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2002.  

With that, Iâ€™ll turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMZN: Thanks, Tim.  

Today Iâ€™ll discuss our financial and operating results, and our future expectations. This was another great year and quarter for Amazon.com, thanks to the efforts of our global teams and partners and our returning and new customers who continued to take advantage of our lower prices, free shipping, and expanded selection.  

Let me start by reviewing 2003. Free cash flow grew 156 percent to $346m driven by improvements in top line growth and operating profit. The combination of common stock outstanding and employee stock based awards was 433m shares, flat with a year ago. Revenues grew 34 percent to $5.26b, adjusting for the $232m of favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rates revenue growth was 28 percent.  

Our international segment, the U.K., Germany, France, and Japan, reached combined sales of over $2b for the first time. Active customer accounts representing customer accounts with purchases in 2003 increased 26 percent to over 39m.  

Consolidated segment operating income doubled to $361m and margin improved 228 basis points to 6.9 percent. North America segment operating margin reached nine percent while international achieved a four percent margin. But more importantly, from our perspective, operating profit dollars for each grew substantially.  

Inventory turns were 18, and inventory was $294m including the foreign exchange impact from inventories held outside the U.S. Inventory again averaged four percent of annual sales while we took advantage of buying opportunities from vendors and bolstered our inventory levels to optimize 2004 worldwide in stock levels across our product categories, including our newer ones.  

Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs, declined six percent from a year ago to $224m. Our capital expenditures were $46m less than depreciation, for the third consecutive year.  

Cash and marketable securities increased to $1.39b including $72m from favorable movement in foreign exchange rates. During the year we repaid $464m of long-term debt, consisting of the remainder of our 10 percent senior discount notes in May and $200m of our U.S. dollar convertible debt in November.  

Today we announced that in February we will redeem an additional $150m of our U.S. dollar convertible debt for face value plus a 2.375 percent premium, which will result in a $6m charge to re-measurement in other in our first quarter GAAP results.  

The combined $350m early repayment of our convertible debt that was otherwise due in 2009 eliminates potential dilution of over 4m shares in addition to reducing our future net cash interest expense. We also announced the program to repurchase or redeem up to an additional $500m of our remaining outstanding convertible debt over time.  

Return on invested capital increased to 38 percent, up from 15 percent calculated using what we believe is a conservative approach to both return in invested capital, free cash flow divided by total assets minus current liabilities.  

Now for a few comments in the quarter. Revenues grew 36 percent to $1.95b, 46 percent of which was shipped to over 200 countries outside the U.S. Adjusting for the $98m favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rates revenue growth was 29 percent.  

Third party units representing the units sold by our partners on our web site grew to 24 percent of total units.  

North America segment revenues grew 18 percent to $1.14b. North American media grew 16 percent, and electronics and other general merchandise revenue grew 22 percent. Electronics and other general merchandise revenue grew 30 percent excluding the toy and baby product categories.  

International segment revenues were $804m, a 74 percent increase. Adjusting for the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rates international revenue growth was 54 percent. International gross margin declined 17 percent driven by lower prices, free shipping, and product mix shift. For example, the electronics and other general merchandise grew to 15 percent of our international sales, up from seven percent of our sales as we invested in low prices in selection in our Japan, Germany, and U.K. stores.  

Consolidated segment operating income grew 50 percent to $153m including a $6m benefit from foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating margin increased to 7.9 percent.  

Pro forma net income grew 66 percent to $125m or 29 cents per diluted share, compared with 19 cents per diluted share. Our GAAP net income was $73m or 17 cents per diluted share, compared with $3m or one cent per share. The net change was primarily the result of the following. First, a $67m increase in operating income. Second, a $36m re-measurement gain corresponding with intercompany balances denominated foreign currencies which are to be repaid among subsidiaries. Third, a $27m increase in the mark-to-market charge from remeasuring our Euro based [debt] [ph] to dollars. And fourth, a $9m charge we incurred in connection with our November 24th early redemption of $200m of our 4-3/4 U.S. dollar convertible debt.  

Our growth continues to be fueled by our relentless focus on the primary inputs into customer experience. Selection, convenience, and price. Iâ€™ll share some of our recent progress for each of these.  

Weâ€™ve expanded selections across our product categories worldwide. In our electronics last year we increased U.S. selection by over 40 percent, significantly increased U.K. and Germany selection, and introduced a new store in Japan. Electronic unit sales increased nearly 50 percent in the U.S. and over 80 percent worldwide.  

Unique items ordered from our U.S. home category more than tripled in the fourth quarter, fueled by greater selection including additions from our newer merchants, The Container Store, Plough & Hearth, and Smith & Hawken.  

Last year we added tens of thousands of titles to our U.K. DVD catalog last year, and the number of unique items ordered more than doubled in Q4. We launched a new home and kitchen store in Japan, and introduced marketplace in France and Canada. Last quarter we also introduced three new stores in the U.S.: Gourmet Food with over 40,000 unique items, Health & Personal Care with over 70,000 unique items, and Jewelry & Watches which now offers over 60,000 unique items.  

Selling alongside Amazon.com in these new stores are great merchants like Dean & DeLuca, Godiva, Harry and David, Omaha Steaks, and Câ€™s Candies, Vitamin Shop, Fossil, fortune off, Mandera, Ross-Simons, and Watchzone.  

In 2003 active seller accounts, those with an order from one of our customers in the last 12 months increased over 70 percent to more than 600,000, including more than 1,000 branded merchants offering new merchandise.  

Expanding Amazon.com and third party selection worldwide in existing and new product categories is a constant focus. While we made great progress in 2003 thereâ€™s more to come. Including new stores weâ€™re currently building that we plan to open and promote over the next year.  

We constantly strive to make our stores more convenient for customers. Last quarter, for example, we introduced Search Inside the Book, facilitating customer discover by allowing text from books from hundreds of participating publishers to be searched and previewed.  

Our global fulfillment centerâ€™s controllable free replacements, an important quality measure, improved over 40 percent, while throughput per hour increased 39 percent. Demonstrated peak holiday unit capacity across our fulfillment centers increased 24 percent. Improved efficiency allowed our fulfillment centers to accommodate our growth without any new automated fulfillment centers again last year, and enabled our U.S. fulfillment centers to extend the holiday free shipping deadline for customers by four additional days to December 16th. While again shipping more than 99 percent of all of our orders in time to meet holiday deadlines.  

In 2003 we substantially increased our technology teams, and in 2004 weâ€™ll continue hiring computer scientists and software engineers to invest in the future innovation for our customers. For the first time since 2000 annual technology and content costs are expected to grow in absolute dollars next year.  

We continue to lower prices to create the best possible value proposition for our customers. As weâ€™ve said before, â€˜at Amazon.com lowering prices worldwide is not an event, itâ€™s the way we run our business.â€™ Our objective is not to discount a small number of products for a limited period of time but to offer low prices every day and apply them broadly across our entire product range.  

Recent examples include free shipping offers around the world to save customers tens of millions of dollars more this fourth quarter. In the U.K., for example, where we tested free shipping on orders over 39 pounds for the first time in holiday 2002 and lowered the threshold to 25 pounds in July 2003 the percentage of units shipped free increased over 1,300 basis points.  

In both media, and electronics, and other general merchandise we lowered prices on thousands of products again last quarter. We heavily promoted our newer stores with discounts off future Amazon.com purchases when customers ordered over $50 of apparel, sporting goods, gourmet food, and jewelry. As a reminder, these offers are recorded against current revenues.  

And today in the U.K. we announced a further reduction in book prices by offering 30 percent off books over 10 pounds. Previously, we offered 30 percent off books over 15 pounds. In 2004 weâ€™ll maintain our relentless focus on finding ways to afford even lower prices. And for years to come weâ€™ll continue assessing the elasticity of demand as we lower prices even further.  

Iâ€™ll conclude my portion of todayâ€™s call with guidance. Incorporated in our Q1 â€™04 guidance in the 2004 baseline expectations are the order trends that weâ€™ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, thereâ€™s a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuations in the Euro, pound, yen, and Canadian dollar foreign exchange rates, as well as the global economy and consumer spending, and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic it is not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Let me also remind everyone that since certain stock awards are subject to variable accounting we incur a non-cash charge or gain for any movement in our share price between reporting dates. And we mark our Euro denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter which results in non-cash gain or loss for any movement in the Euro between reporting dates. We also have exposure to the Euro related to our unhedged interest expense on this Euro denominated debt, and we incur a non-cash foreign currency gain or loss corresponding with intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies which are to be repaid among subsidiaries. We cannot forecast these items, yet they could have a significant impact either positively or negatively on our results.  

For the March quarter we expect net sales of between $1.39b and $1.49b, or a growth of between 28 and 38 percent. Consolidated segment operating income is to be between $95m and $150m, or grow between 41 and 70 percent.  

For calendar 2004 our expectations are that net sales of between $6.2b and $6.7b or growth of between 18 and 27 percent. Consolidated segment operating income could be between $430m and $530m, or growth of between 19 and 47 percent. While we expect to generate year-over-year growth we will also continue to invest in our long-term opportunities.  

We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development costs to be less than $100m. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates stay approximately where theyâ€™ve been recently. We cannot predict fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Finally, when we think about growth weâ€™re concerned with long-term growth of free cash flow. Thatâ€™s ultimately how weâ€™ll measure our success.  

Before opening up to questions let me close by looking forward for the next several years. We will be on the leading edge of technology and innovation, weâ€™ll continue investing over $200m a year in technology and content because we believe thereâ€™s a lot more innovation ahead of us than behind us. Weâ€™ll continually challenge ourselves on whether weâ€™re delivering the best possible customer experience in the lowest possible prices. In addition to the inherent benefits of shopping online weâ€™re determined to create a unique experience for customers globally.  

Our growth in existing countries and as we expand to additional countries will continue to be driven by increased selection and new and existing categories, including more third party sellers, greater convenience, and progressively lower prices. We believe that these initiatives combined with the advantages of our model, and strong execution against our many challenges will meet the high returns on invested capital and sustainable growth in free cash flow. Customer experience comes first at Amazon.com, and we believe that that approach drives the best long-term returns for our shareholders.  

Thanks, and with that, Tim, letâ€™s move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Great, thanks, Tom. Letâ€™s move onto the q and a portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. In the interest of allowing as many people as possible to ask a question please limit yourself to one question.  

Operator, if you could remind our listeners how to ask a question, weâ€™ll proceed.  

OPERATOR: Yes, sir. (Caller Instructions.)  

Weâ€™ll take our first question from Heath Terry with CS First Boston.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CS FIRST BOSTON: Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about, I mean it looks like this quarter we saw unit growth and revenue growth near each other a little more than weâ€™ve seen in the last few quarters. Is it fair to say that maybe weâ€™re seeing the third party business reach a little bit more of a steady state here as a percentage of revenue? And if that is or isnâ€™t the case what would you suggest we expect going forward in terms of the growth of the third party business relative to what youâ€™re doing first party?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Certainly from a third party perspective what weâ€™re trying to do is offer great selection of prices, and our customers are going to ultimately decide what that mix is going to be. You know, you should expect us to continue to add selection to the seller, as well as all of our third parties.  

As it relates to the compression question that you had specifically, what youâ€™re seeing is certainly the mix within our business of [EGM] [ph] being a higher percentage of the total during Q4 is making that compression narrower. Thatâ€™s being offset by clearly we continue to lower prices for our customers, so our prices on all of our products continue to go down, as well as with third party mix. And so our third party business is doing very, very well. Itâ€™s still growing, you know, very dramatically as you can see by the percentage of our total units.  

HEATH TERRY: And in terms of what we should expect for â€™04?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yeah, weâ€™re not giving any, you know, specific guidance going forward on third party units, but again, ultimately our customers will decide what that mix is. But, again, we plan on offering great selection and continuing to add more selection from third parties as well as Amazon as a seller.  

HEATH TERRY: Great, thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks.  

OPERATOR: Weâ€™ll take our next question from Jeetil Patil with Deustche Bank Securities.  

JEETIL PATIL, ANALYST, DEUSTCHE BANK SECURITIES: Hey, guys. A couple of questions. First of all, on the capex I think you said $100m, can you clarify that? And I guess how many DCs that youâ€™re kind of planning on for this year in that number, or any new countries or markets that you may be looking at in general embedded in that assumption?  

And then, secondly, as you look at the â€“t looked like you got to about 35 percent unit growth for 2003 overall. But you know, if you look at the drivers of selection versus pricing or prices what do you think is going to be the bigger driver? It looks like itâ€™s more prices in 2004, do you think it would be a little more balanced between selection and prices, kind of this year? And, you know, would move over to pricing as being the bigger driver of the business over the next several years? Can you kind of clarify kind of where did the growth come from, which element of the business?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks, Jeetil. To answer the first part of your question, yeah, we said that capex would be less than $100m in 2004. Weâ€™ve certainly challenged the team. We donâ€™t anticipate a new automated fulfillment center in the U.S. in 2004 based on the guidance that weâ€™ve given.  

As it relates to your question about â€˜which is going to have the bigger impact, selection or pricing,â€™ the reality is we donâ€™t know, weâ€™re working on both. Weâ€™re going to continue to make sure that we expand selection in all of the existing categories that we have today. Obviously, offering new categories going forward, and make sure that we have the best possible prices. And so you should expect to see lower prices in all of our categories. It will come in a number of different forms. Weâ€™ll continue to obviously get greater adoption, we think, in supersaver shipping globally, as well as just lower prices across-the-board. So you should expect more selection and lower prices going forward.  

JEETIL PATIL: Tom, are you putting any more emphasis on selection in the near term relative to pricing, or pricing relative to selection?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Yeah, we donâ€™t look at them separately. We, again, our goal is to offer the best possible prices. And so we will be lowering prices more in 2004 and will be expanding selection.  

OPERATOR: Weâ€™ll take our next question from [Mary Meeker] [ph] with Morgan Stanley.  

MARY MEEKER, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Yes, thanks, Tom. Brian and I have a couple of questions, and you may have â€“an you hear us?  

JEFFREY BEZOS, CEO, AMZN: Hey, Mary, can you hold on one sec, I just wanted to add to that previous answer.  

MARY MEEKER: Oh, yeah, go ahead.  

JEFFREY BEZOS: Just to say the two things are not linked and theyâ€™re not tradeoffs, and so there are, you know, we can proceed on lowering prices quite independently from the efforts that we undertake to increase selection. And, in fact, weâ€™ll be able to increase selection in terms of breadth of selection across new categories but also continue the efforts that weâ€™ve been making all along within existing categories continuing to increase selection.  

So I just wanted to kind of emphasize the point that Tom already made, that thereâ€™s really no tradeoff in our model between increasing selection and lowering prices. And you should expect to see us very strongly do both in the coming years.  

So, go ahead, Mary.  

MARY MEEKER: Great, thanks, Jeff. Do we get two questions here? Specifically, on the gross margin outlook, youâ€™ve kind of in the last, in the answer to Heathâ€™s question and Jeetilâ€™s question youâ€™ve talked around pricing and shipping, the tradeoff, third party, et cetera. But your gross margin in the December quarter was the lowest itâ€™s been in a long time. Should we expect, Tom, that 21.9 percent give or take 100 or so basis points on either side is kind of the range we should see on a go-forward basis?  

And then a second question would be, Tom, you talked about electronic selection rising about 40 percent, and selection rising across the site generally, do you have a number for the aggregate increase in selections either for full year â€™03 or for the fourth quarter, specifically? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, just taking the first part of your question, we certainly are not giving guidance on gross margin going forward. But Iâ€™ll tell you how weâ€™re certainly thinking about it internally. And which, and related back to Q4. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™re seeing. You should expect to see, you know, again, looking at it from a year-over-year perspective in any given quarter you should expect to see pressure on gross margins. And, again, thatâ€™s something that weâ€™ve been talking about for a long time because weâ€™re going to continue to invest in lower prices, weâ€™re going to continue to invest in new categories.  

And so what youâ€™re seeing in Q4 specifically is we invested very, very heavily in all of the new categories within electronics and general merchandise. You can see that, you know, clearly in our international results. We lowered prices substantially in all of our categories. We had great, an example of the U.K., we had great adoption and supersaver delivery in the U.K. in Q4. And so, again, thatâ€™s what youâ€™re seeing in terms of pressure on gross margins. We view that as a great investment in the business and a great investment, you know, that youâ€™ll see benefits from going forward.  

Combined with that what youâ€™re seeing is our model is working. Weâ€™re seeing, you know, great growth in our total business, and youâ€™re seeing operating margins expanding even though gross margins are coming down. So, again, we have for fourth quarter we had North America operating margins of 10 percent, so highest ever. Fourth quarter we also had international operating margins of just under five percent, again our best ever, you know, with significant increases year-over-year.  

So, again, pressure on gross margins driving the top line, but seeing expanding operating margins. So thatâ€™s something weâ€™ve been talking about for quite some time, and we think itâ€™s exactly what you want to see going forward.  

In terms of selection, again, we havenâ€™t disclosed our total selection increases in terms of the [indications] [ph] across all of Amazon, but again, thatâ€™s something that we focus on every day. Itâ€™s a constant focus for our business, and you know, we definitely increased selection dramatically, and youâ€™ll definitely see more of that going forward.  

MARY MEEKER: Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Tom.  

JEFFREY BEZOS: Iâ€™ll just add to the gross margin answer. The, what youâ€™re seeing there is very consistent with our strategy in that weâ€™re making a choice to return, as we have success in the business to return some of the operating efficiencies and so on that we are getting to customers in the form of significantly lower prices, through supersaver shipping, and so on. And so these are conscious choices that weâ€™re making, and weâ€™re not trying to optimize the company for gross margins, weâ€™re trying to optimize the company for aggregate free cash flow in absolute dollar terms.  

And so, you know, weâ€™ll try to, as we know more about the elasticity and how we can drive demand with lower prices, and so on, weâ€™ll try to do the right thing with respect to margins. So, you know, but we can be quite analytical about that, and it is our, you know, we will for years, and years, and years consistently give back the gains that we get to customers in the form of lower prices. We think thatâ€™s the right way to operate this business.  

OPERATOR: Weâ€™ll take our next question from Anthony Noto with Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you, very much, Jeff and Tom. A couple of questions. The first question is why donâ€™t you give comment on the performance of the non-book, music, and video categories in the North American business? It grew just 22 percent which is a pretty significant deceleration. And as you talk about the performance of that, whether youâ€™re satisfied or not? And specifically how apparel has done now that itâ€™s been open one year, and what that means for the opening of other new stores as you move down your new store opening path?  

Secondly, focusing on the gross profit dollars as opposed to the margin, and the cost of goods sold. If I strip-out your shipping costs of goods sold and just look at your product costs of goods sold it grew 40.7 percent year-over-year in the December quarter which is a significant acceleration from where itâ€™s been and much greater than your gross profit dollar. And so I was wondering what was going on with the gross profit â€“â€™m sorry, cost of goods sold dollars that are non-shipping related?  

And then, lastly, your incremental margins in the quarter were 9.8 percent, and thatâ€™s the first time we havenâ€™t seen a double-digit incremental operating margin since back in the beginning of 2002. Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Great. Just to take the first piece, if you look at the North America, basically the EGM growth that you mentioned of 22 percent. Just for looking at the total year for a second, our total year growth in EGM was 29 percent in 2003. If you look at Q4 our growth was 22 percent. If you back-out our toy and baby business that growth was actually 30 percent. And if youâ€™ll recall, we sold our toy catalog business back in Q3, and thatâ€™s a significant portion of that delta that I described. So thatâ€™s the EGM piece.  

You also asked about apparel specifically, weâ€™re actually very pleased with our apparel business. We actually had substantial unit growth during Q4 year-over-year even though we were lapping some very large promotions that we did last Q4. And so, again, weâ€™re very pleased with our performance in our apparel category.  

From a cost of goods sold you are certainly seeing a significant increase, but, again, the way weâ€™re looking at it internally is itâ€™s really around again how are we going to invest within the business to make sure we have the best, lowest possible prices, again, so youâ€™re seeing lower prices impacting gross margin. Youâ€™re seeing supersaver delivery doing that, as well, and the mix of EGM driving that, as well. And so itâ€™s difficult to isolate just the cost of goods piece, okay, without looking at the other pieces of the equation.  

And Iâ€™m sorry, the last question I think related to, you said the 9.8 percent which was really the incremental operating margin or the incremental operating leverage. If you take a look at it in pieces youâ€™ll see that the North America incremental operating margin was consistent with where its been over the previous several quarters. When you look at the international segment youâ€™ll see that itâ€™s a little bit less than that, at least on a, you know, when you compare it to the trailing 12-month basis. And thatâ€™s exactly the way I described it earlier.  

Again, weâ€™re very pleased with our international business. What we did in Q4 specifically was we invested very heavily in our electronics and general merchandise in terms of, in the form of lower prices and increased selection. EGM mix as a percentage of our total revenue international was 15 percent. If you compare that to Q4 of â€™02 it was less than seven percent. We had great success in adoption rates within the U.K. of our supersaver delivery, again, reducing that threshold back in Q3.  

So, again, all of those things contributed to the numbers that you just referred to. But, again, our international business in total weâ€™re extremely pleased with. Up, you know, we exceeded $2b in revenue for the first time, up 52 percent year-over-year excluding exchange. We had zero operating margin in 2002. We had four percent operating margin in 2003. We generated $78m worth of operating profit in our international segment. And weâ€™re going to do more of it. We announced today that weâ€™re going to lower prices even further in the U.K. by going to 30 percent off books over 10 pounds.  

So, again, if you look at the total picture for our international segment weâ€™re extremely pleased. Itâ€™s consistent with the message weâ€™ve been sending to all of our investors, and weâ€™re going to do more of the same.  

ANTHONY NOTO: Tom, you didnâ€™t mention the fourth quarter or what unit girth number, did you? I didnâ€™t catch that on the call.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, our fourth quarter unit growth number was 33 percent.  

ANTHONY NOTO: Thank you.  

OPERATOR: Thank you. Weâ€™ll take our next question from Safa Rashtchy with Piper Jaffrey.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFREY: Good afternoon, Tom, Jeff. A question for you first, Tom. Can you â€“ donâ€™t understand that youâ€™re not giving any guidance on the gross margins, but with a fairly substantial drop in the international gross margins how long do you think it will take before that stabilizes? As I look at the trend at the U.S. operations took, it seems like it took about three or four quarters to stabilize. Could we expect that? Are you just beginning the price cuts and the free shippings that could further accelerate the gross margin erosion?  

And a follow-up for you, Jeff, if I may. Could you, again, I know we have talked about this in previous calls about your philosophy of lower prices, but Iâ€™m still trying to understand that at this very early stage of e-commerce growth that thereâ€™s a lot more ahead of us, that 30 percent growth, why does it make this much sense to be the price leader given that you really donâ€™t have much competition in the U.S. or even outside the U.S.? Thereâ€™s still increased adoption after youâ€™re online for convenience and selection, and so could you maybe talk about that a little bit, please. Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: The first part of it on gross margins, you know, we certainly donâ€™t give guidance going forward. But, again, from a gross margin standpoint, again, in international you did see reductions in gross margins year-over-year. We saw expansions in operating margins also year-over-year, both Q4 and the total year.  

And so, again, thatâ€™s something when weâ€™re investing in new categories, as you can imagine with EGM being 15 percent of our total revenue, and international up from, you know, Q4 of â€™02 what was less than seven percent, you can imagine that weâ€™re being very aggressive on pricing, make sure that we have the best possible pricing. We have, you should expect that our gross margins are lower in that category, in our international business versus the rest of our international business. But, again, thatâ€™s something that we want to do to make sure that we, you know, grow that business. And so, again, you should expect to see continued pressure on gross margin and expansion in operating profit dollars.  

JEFFREY BEZOS: And in answer to the, you know, â€˜why pursue a strategy of relentlessly lowering prices year in and year out?â€™ The answer is that it is one of the important customer experience drivers. And so we know that the things that matter to customers are convenience, selection, lower prices. And that is a very stable set of desires. Those things are not going to change. Customers are always going to want those things.  

You may recall that a couple of years ago we did a one-year long test of television advertising, and very controlled tests. We did it in two markets. And we were able to measure with some significant, some statistical significance the lift of our sales in those two markets as a result of doing that television test. While there was a lift, that lift was not great enough for our business to justify that television advertising. In other words, we could demonstrate to ourselves that through things like free supersaver shipping and lower product prices that the combination of those things would actually be better for our business than spending an equivalent amount of money on television advertising.  

So, in effect, what weâ€™re doing is weâ€™ve made a deliberate decision to go down a particular path, and that path is instead of, you know, giving the money to the television networks give the money back to our customers.  

SAFA RASHTCHY: Thanks, thatâ€™s helpful.  

OPERATOR: Weâ€™ll take our next question from Lanny Baker with Smith Barney.  

LANNY BAKER, ANALYST, SMITH BARNEY: Thanks a lot. Thereâ€™s been a lot of discussion of the gross margin, and so to try to move it beyond that, you all talk about driving your business from a free cash flow maximization or optimization standpoint. And I was wondering if you could do two things? One, is there a roadmap you can provide that links the segment income to free cash flow? What portion of it, what portion of segment operating income you think the model will convert into free cash flow sustainably? I mean itâ€™s improved pretty nicely year-to-year, does it continue to improve the conversion of segment income?  

And then, secondly, maybe a simple question, but can you talk a little bit about how the levers of new categories, lower prices, free shipping, third party feed free cash flow in sort of bright line terms to kind of simplify it so that I guess you could draw more clearly the line between the levers that youâ€™re using to drive the business, and the outcome that youâ€™re trying to generate for shareholders?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. As far as the question on segments and how they trend to free cash flow, certainly over time they should trend together. Thatâ€™s what our expectation will be. We certainly donâ€™t, you know, break those out separately for you, you know, externally today. But, again, they should trend together over time.  

Iâ€™m sorry, the second part of the question, Lanny, was, again?  

LANNY BAKER: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how your categories or lower prices, or free shipping, sort of what are the simple ways to think about how those things have impacted the sustainable free cash flow levels that youâ€™re generating? And how, you know, adding the new categories that youâ€™ve added, or lowering prices another round in Europe? What are sort of the mechanics of how that powers free cash?  

JEFFREY BEZOS: The simplest way to think about that is that the better you can make your customer experience, and lower prices are a version of better customer experience, the more customers youâ€™ll attract, the larger share of that householdâ€™s purchases you will attract, and so on and so on. So you can become a more, a bigger, you know, a bigger part of a customerâ€™s life by just simply doing a better job for them.  

Itâ€™s a very, very simple minded approach. And one that I think is, you know, the results over the last couple of years since we started taking this approach, I think to a degree speak for themselves. You know, this kind of focus on the customer experience including low prices, weâ€™d always been very customer experienced focused from the very beginning but we had focused primarily on selection and convenience. Starting a few years ago we layered on top of that this focus on low prices, as well. And those three drivers are really important to customers, and so they drive the amount of business that we do with each individual customer simply because weâ€™re doing a better job with them.  

And as that happens, you know, if you operate the business efficiently, thatâ€™s the other side, you canâ€™t, lowering prices is easy, itâ€™s being able to afford to do so thatâ€™s difficult. And so lowering prices and having that be the companyâ€™s strategy or big portion of our strategy is difficult in as much as it forces us to take on the job of being very operationally efficient, very productive, trying to do things in smarter ways, trying to reduce defects because defects are so expensive. But this is all goodness, and that is, you know, thatâ€™s really what weâ€™re trying to do is put these, we have the company on that path and weâ€™re going to stay on it.  

OPERATOR: And weâ€™ll take our last question from [Daryl Smith] [ph] with JP Morgan.  

DARYL SMITH, ANALYST, JP MORGAN: Great, first question, what do you believe is the penetration of your active user base that is taking advantage of your free shipping? And what is the longer term opportunity to convert those users who are not aware of it? And also, giving that weâ€™re now anniversaried if weâ€™re shipping off in all quarters what do you see is driving your growth in 2004? And I have a follow-up question, as well.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Certainly, we have a very, you know, our adoption rates as it relates to free shipping has been, you know, increasing over time. And what weâ€™re trying to do is try to find the right thresholds and in many cases, you know, we think we have. And so weâ€™re going to continue to test to make sure that we have the right levels, and if we think thereâ€™s an opportunity to change that, you know, weâ€™ll certainly consider doing that.  

What was the other part of your question, Daryl? Iâ€™m sorry.  

DARYL SMITH: I asked about your, you know, given that youâ€™ve anniversaried the free shipping offers in all of the quarters as you have in the Q1 through Q3 of this year what do you see is driving your growth in 2004?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Again, itâ€™s more of the same as we talked about earlier in the call. Weâ€™re going to make sure that we have the best possible prices, and so weâ€™re going to be lowering prices more during 2004, and weâ€™re going to expand selection. Thatâ€™s going to be in existing categories, as well as new categories going forward. And so thatâ€™s the plan, and you know, we think that our customers are responding nicely to that. And weâ€™re going to continue to do more of the same.  

DARYL SMITH: And, finally, one last question here. As you look to the international category expansion is that going to be more of a marketplace model given your lower startup costs? And also, can you comment of the success of Japan in the quarter, which we didnâ€™t talk about?  

TOM SZKUTAK: You know, certainly, today itâ€™s a retail model over the long term. Certainly, you should expect that, as well.  

JEFFREY BEZOS: Yeah, itâ€™ll â€“eâ€™ll, if you look at our international businesses, you know, we have a very healthy marketplace, business internationally, where we do third party units. And we will continue to do both, and you know, thereâ€™s some things that we can do very efficiently and thereâ€™s some things that some of our partners can do very efficiently, and working together we can do a better job for the customers than any of us alone can do.  

DARYL SMITH: Okay, thanks.  

TIM STONE: With that, I want to thank everyone for joining us on our call today. As a reminder, a replay will be available on our Investor Relations web site at least through the end of the quarter. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thanks, again, for your interest in Amazon.com.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Thank you.  

JEFFREY BEZOS: Thank you.  

OPERATOR: This does conclude todayâ€™s conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Additional information on factors that could potentially affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2002 and all subsequent filings.  

As you listen to today's call, I encourage you to have our press release in front of you since all of our financial results, as well as commentary on the quarter are included and will correspond to much of the discussion that follows. During this call we will also present certain non-GAAP financial measures. In the release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons used in this call will be against the results for the comparable period of 2002. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.  

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP, CFO, AMAZON.COM: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will discuss our financial and operating results and our future expectations. This was another great quarter for Amazon.com, driven by our customers who continue to take advantage of our lower prices, free shipping and expanded selection.  

A few highlights for the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis grew 100 percent to $239m, driven by improvements in operating profit. The combination of common stock outstanding and employee-based stock awards increased 1 percent to 433m shares.  

Worldwide unit growth was 36 percent, and total units served increased sequentially. Over the trailing 12 months, units grew 37 percent. Third party units representing units sold by our partners on our websites grew to 22 percent of total units.  

Revenue grew 33 percent to $1.13b, adjusting for the $29m favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rates, and for the $170m impact over the trailing 12 months, revenue growth was 30 percent again this quarter and 26 percent over the trailing 12 months.  

Active customer accounts representing customers with purchases in the last 12 months increased 27 percent to 37m. North America segment revenues grew 21 percent to $709m. North America electronics and other general merchandise revenue grew 35 percent and even though Q2 included Harry Potter 5, our North American media growth rate accelerated sequentially to 15 percent.  

International segment revenues were $425m, a 61 percent increase. Adjusting for the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates compared with Q3 of 2002, international revenue growth was 50 percent.  

Consolidated segment operating expenses increased 12 percent and segment operating income was $74m, including a $1m benefit from foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating margin increased over 300 basis points to 6.5 percent. Pro forma net income was $48m, or 11 cents per diluted share compared with zero cents per share.  

Our GAAP net income was $16m, or 4 cents per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $35m, or 9 cents per share. This net change was primarily the result of the following. First, a $62m increase in operating income. Second, a $12m increase in the market to market charge related to our Euro based debt. Third, a $2m gain on the sale of our toy catalog business, which in its seasonally peak fourth quarter last year had sales of $13m and a few million of contribution profit.  

Finally, on our balance sheet inventory was $242m and trailing 12 month inventory returns were 19 as we made substantial progress towards our inventory build for the holidays and took advantage of various buying opportunities from our vendors. Compared with a year ago, we took receipt of more holiday inventory including pre-release titles and expect record in-stock levels this holiday season.  

Correspondingly, AP days increased to 54 for the quarter and 47 days over the trailing 12 months. Our investment in fixed assets, which includes net capitalized software development costs declined 7 percent from a year ago to $221m while revenues grew 31 percent over the trailing 12 months.  

For the third consecutive year, we expect our reinvestment ratio, or capital expenditures divided by depreciation to be less than one. Cash and marketable securities increased to $1.6b. As a reminder, in May we paid $277m to redeem our 10 percent senior discount notes.  

Our growth continues to be fueled by a relentless focus on the primary inputs into customer experience; selection, convenience and price. I will share our recent progress for each of these.  

We've expanded selection in new categories as well as in existing countries and product categories. We've launched a sporting goods store, which has over 125 merchants offering their selection of 3,000 brands in 50 sports. We've launched the consumer electronics store in Japan.  

Many new merchants including Bombay, Cooking.com, Kitchen Etc., Lance Plus, Northern Tools, True Value and Wine Enthusiasts began offering their selection to their customers on our Amazon.com home and garden stores.  

And nearly a year after launching our apparel store, over 600,000 customers have ordered an apparel item. The number of apparel brands has more than tripled to over 1,500. There are over 100,000 unique items and the number of apparel merchants has increased fivefold to over 150, including recently Jay Jill, K Swiss and Pacific Sunwear.  

And there is more selection to come. We are currently building a number of new stores that we plan to open and promote over the next year, and will continue to add third-party sellers worldwide who will join our more than 550,000 active seller accounts, those with an order from one of our customers in the last 12 months, including over 350 branded sellers offering front line new merchandise.  

We constantly strive to make our stores more convenient for customers. For example, our cycle time, the amount of time taken by our global fulfillment centers to process a customer order, was 10 percent faster than Q3 of 2002. Customer contacts per order, one of our most important measures of satisfaction, decreased by 17 percent.  

We introduced, "Look Inside the Manual", giving our customers easy access to over 15,000 electronic product manuals, and we are working on several new features we plan to introduce to customers this holiday season.  

We continue to lower prices to create the best possible value proposition for our customers. As we said before, at Amazon.com lowering prices worldwide is not an event, it's the way we run our business. Our objective is not to discount a small number of products for a limited period of time, but to offer low prices every day and apply them broadly across our entire product range.  

Recent examples include free shipping offers around the world have saved customers tens of millions of dollars so far this year. We lowered our top hundred DVDs to 30 percent off or more, and electronics and other general merchandise we've lowered prices on thousands of products again last quarter and we are heavily promoting our newest stores with discounts off future Amazon.com purchases when customers make a purchase over $50 off sporting goods, apparel and shoes.  

In Q4 in 2004 [SI1]we'll maintain our relentless focus on finding ways to afford even lower prices, and for years to come we will continue assessing the elasticity of demand over time as we lower prices even further.  

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance for Q4 of 2003 and our baseline expectations for next year. Incorporated into our Q403 guidance and the 2004 expectations are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.  

However, we also recognize we are lapsing our prior year price reductions, particularly $25 free shipping in the U.S., and there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding fluctuation in foreign exchange rates as well as the global economy and consumer spending and the impact on both of world events.  

While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Let me also remind everyone that since certain stock awards are subject to variable accounting, we incur non-cash charge or gain for any movement in our share price between reporting dates, and we mark our Euro-denominated debt to market at the end of each quarter, which results in a non-cash gain or loss for any movement in the Euro between reporting dates.  

We also have exposure to the Euro related to our unhedged interest expense on this Euro-denominated debt. We cannot forecast these items, yet they could have a significant impact either positively or negatively on our results.  

For the December quarter, we expect net sales of between $1.76b and $1.91b, a growth of between 23 percent and 34 percent. Consolidated segment operating profit to be between $125m and $155. For the calendar year of 2004, our expectations are net sales of between $5.75b and $6.25b, or based on our fourth quarter guidance, growth of between 13 percent and 20 percent.  

Consolidated segment operating profit to be between $375m and $475m. While we expect to generate year-over-year growth, we also intend to continue to invest in our long-term opportunities. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs to be less than $100m. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates stay approximately where they've been recently. We cannot predict fluctuations in the Euro, Pound, Yen, Canadian Dollar or other foreign exchange rates.  

Also when you think about growth we are concerned with long-term growth for free cash flow. That is ultimately how we will measure our success. Before opening up to questions, let me close by looking forward to the next several years.  

We will be on the leading edge of technology and innovation. We will continue investing over $200m a year in technology and content, including hiring more software engineers and computer scientists next year, because we believe there is a lot more innovation ahead of us than behind us.  

In addition to the inherent benefits of shopping online, we are creating unique customer experience for customers globally. We are determined to offer both world-class customer experience and the lowest possible prices. We will focus on further improving our customer experience, continually challenging ourselves on whether we are delivering the best possible customer experience worldwide.  

Our growth in existing countries, and as we expand to additional countries, will continue to be driven by increase selection in new and existing categories, including more third-party sellers, greater convenience and progressively lower prices.  

We believe that these initiatives, combined with the advantages of our model and strong execution against our many challenges will lead to high returns on invested capital and sustainable growth and free cash flow.  

Finally, customer experience comes first at Amazon.com and we believe that that approach drives the best long-term results for our shareholders. Thanks, and with that Tim, let's move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. In the interest of allowing as many people as possible to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question. Operator, if you could remind our listeners how to ask a question we will proceed.  

OPERATOR: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question today is from Lanny Baker from Solomon Smith Barney.  

LANNY BAKER, ANALYST, SOLOMON SMITH BARNEY: Thanks a lot. You know, Tom, after making something, 250 basis points of improvement in your consolidated segment operating margins over the last 12 months, it looks like the guidance from here to next year is not much improvement in profitability, maybe up to 100 basis points more if I am doing the math right. What is the change, what changes between the last year and the next year that would shift the profitability improvement?  

In addition to that, I was wondering if you could talk about, you know, over the last year the free shipping seems to really have helped unit volume and stimulated revenue growth. Can you talk about the velocity of your pricing on merchandise in the next 12 months given that in the last 12 months you benefited from free shipping on top of the list price reductions that you were making. Should we think that the list prices come down faster, or they come down at the same rate over the next 12 months as you cycle now past the free shipping benefit?  

TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of the first part of your question related to the expectations for 2004, it is obviously very difficult to get visibility out that far and so we think that certainly the guidance is appropriately conservative. We think we are focused on the right inputs to drive growth, to get cost out. We are going to continue, obviously, to make sure that we continue to add selection, have great pricing.  

So again, I think the guidance is appropriate but again, it is appropriately conservative given the time that is out there.  

In terms of the second part of your question, if you could just repeat that, I am not sure I understood the question as it related to pricing.  

LANNY BAKER: Well I guess in the last year you had the twin drivers from a volume perspective; price reductions on merchandise and also free shipping. Now going forward, free shipping sort of incrementally wouldn't be as much of a stimulant to unit volume.  

I was wondering whether you then turn back and spin the dial a little bit more aggressively on pricing to drive unit volume, or not.  

JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT, CEO AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, AMAZON.COM: I'll take a pass at that. This is Jeff, and Tom can add to it if he likes. I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that when you do something like free supersaver shipping, it actually takes multiple years for a customer base the size of ours to really internalize that and to change their behavior.  

So even though we have rolled over the anniversary of free supersaver shipping, it's not like we've gotten the full benefit from that. In fact, we think that it will take a long time for all of our customers to realize that particular feature of the way we do business and to fully take advantage of it.  

TOM SZKUTAK: I think just to add to that also, we are continually lowering prices. As I mentioned in the script, in electronics and general merchandise we lowered prices on over 1,000 different items. We did a similar thing last quarter.  

Also, you know, outside of the U.S. we are continually focusing on lowering prices as well. We lowered the threshold in the U.K. for the supersaver delivery to 25 pounds three months ago, and again you are seeing that reflected in the Q3 results.  

So again, it's a continuous focus and I absolutely agree with Jeff - it certainly takes a long time for customers to see it and realize that.  

LANNY BAKER: Okay, thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS: Lowering prices will go on for years and years and years. I mean, that is just the way we are going to do business. What we are doing is trying to focus on cost structure and be as lean as we can so we can continue to pass on those savings to customers, and we'll figure out significant ways to do that over the coming years.  

OPERATOR: We will go next to Mary Meeker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.  

MARY MEEKER, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks. A couple of questions. You indicated that third party sales were 22 percent of units in the quarter, that momentum continues to build. Jeff, I think in the past you've thrown out some numbers that were very early stage estimates that you might get up to a third of your units coming from third-party sales. If I am misquoting you, I apologize and stand to be corrected shortly. But where do you think that may go given that you've gotten more insight into how that builds?  

The second question is, you are clearly embracing a lot of the retailers, the momentum seems to be pretty strong, can you give us some thoughts on how confident you are and they are that that is going to be a key driver of an ongoing ramp in the third party sales as the net in effect is back with strong momentum and those companies are finding that you are really providing a valuable service to them, if that's the case?  

JEFF BEZOS: Mary, on the first part, we don't take a position on what fraction of our unit sales will be third party versus our own owned-inventory business. For the simple reason that what we try to do is provide the best possible customer experience in both of those buckets, and then let customers decide over time what that ratio should be.  

It's hard to know what the right - I'm not sure there is any right ratio, and so we are not targeting any specific ratio. With respect to the third party business in general, we continue to see as you can tell from the unit numbers, very strong adoption. We are driving a lot of demand for third party sellers. We have a very good e-commerce platform which the new Amazon Services unit is basically making available for any e-commerce company that wants to have a best-of-breed e-commerce website for its customers.  

So there is genuine value there for both consumers and for the third parties, and we are just going to keep our heads down, focused on trying to drive that value more every year.  

TIM STONE: Great, thanks Mary. Operator, next question.  

OPERATOR: We have a question from Heath Terry from CSFB. Please go ahead.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CS FIRST BOSTON: Great. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, we saw gross margins in the international business come down this quarter, and I understand new free shipping and that kind of thing. Is there anything beyond the free shipping promotion that we should be thinking about in terms of margins in the international business, and is there any reason that over time we shouldn't expect that the international segment can get to the same kinds of margins that the U.S. segment is seeing now?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. In terms of Q3 specifically, the free shipping is one aspect. We've also dramatically lowered prices in parts of our international segment. The third aspect is, we have a very heavy consumer electronics and general merchandise mix as you can see from our results, so those are the three drivers for the lower margins during Q3. But again, we are very optimistic, we've made a lot of progress in our international segment and we think over time that that will certainly grow over time from an operating margin standpoint. And again, we've made a lot of progress there.  

HEATH TERRY: Thanks.  

OPERATOR: We have a question from Anthony Noto from Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much. Looking at the quarter, Tom, it looks like operating expenses on a year-over-year basis grew for the first time double digits, as far back as I can remember. I was wondering, especially in the context of your comment about continuing to invest in technology, will you continue to make incremental investments at a double digit year over year growth rate in 2004? Especially given it looks like you are sort of guiding to a 7 percent operating margin at the midpoint of your range.  

And then secondly, if I look at the growth rate in revenue on a year-over-year basis, relative to unit growth on a quarterly basis, the delta or gap between the two has started to converge. As we think about 2004 revenue growth of 16 percent, would unit growth be greater or less than that growth rate? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure, to answer the first part of your question, operating expenses were up 12 percent, and again, it is the first time we've seen double digit. I think the two things that you should be aware of is certainly as our third party business continues to grow, there is an element of that, credit card bad debt, obviously that grows more on a GMS basis as opposed to a net revenue basis.  

The other part that's impacting this also within our expenses is certainly foreign currency. So again, if you back out the two of those for the quarter you get down to a much smaller single digit growth relative to a 30 percent revenue growth, excluding exchange rate.  

So again, revenue is growing about 30 percent ex-exchange; operating expenses are growing a small single digit number when you back out credit card bad debt in both periods and the effect of foreign exchange.  

So again, what is that going to look like going forward? We are still going to continue to invest heavily in technology and content. We think that is obviously the right thing to do and we are going to invest heavily on everything surrounding our inputs that help us drive growth within our business.  

So we are not specifying any specific absolute value. We haven't disclosed any of that yet. Again, what you will see is you will see productivity over time. You will see our expense to revenue over the long term continue to decline.  

And the second part of your question, related to again units and revenue? Could you repeat that part again?  

ANTHONY NOTO: Yes, the mid-point of your guidance range I think is about 16 percent, correct me if I'm wrong. I was just wondering, is that based on a unit growth rate that is greater than or less than the growth rate implied by absolute revenue of 16 percent?  

TOM SZKUTAK: It's hard to say at this point. We're obviously not giving guidance today surrounding units, and again it is difficult to say what our competitor is going to do in this environment in 2004. So it is difficult to say.  

ANTHONY NOTO: Thank you.  

OPERATOR: Our next question is from Jeetil Patel of Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Hey guys, a couple of questions. You have 37m active customers today. Kind of by our estimates you have maybe total, that have transacted with Amazon about 65m to 70m. I know you've talked about just in general about free shipping having not really hit the entire customer base.  

What do you think as you look at the next 30m to 35m customers that you can go after, what really drives them to cross the chasm and transact with Amazon and become happy customers? Are there different demographics that this customer is, or is it more of a pricing issue, diversity of retail partners, what do you think are the key elements to drive your penetration of that audience?  

And then secondly, as you look at the third party business, can you comment on how integration is going and interest level from partners both on the retail front as well as the vendor community out there? Do you see any particular trends within those particular segments of the market?  

JEFF BEZOS: I'll take a pass at this. As far as you know, sort of the next tens of millions of customers and what will drive their adopting our service, I believe it is many of the same things we've been working on for the last eight years.  

One of them that I think is particularly relevant to this particular question is selection. So as we continue to expand selection, we become relevant to a wider set of customers. So there are a lot of people who buy media products, but there are people who don't buy a lot of media products.  

So we need to continue expanding into new product categories and increasing the depth of selection in the categories we are already in. That's one of the ways that we will make ourselves more relevant to a wider group.  

At the same time, focusing on lower cost structure and therefore being able to return lower prices to customers, continue on that strategy, that's going to be equally important as we go forward. So those are the two big drivers. Increasing selection across categories and driving even lower prices. So you can count on us to keep working on both of those things just as hard as we can.  

With respect to integration, we have several different ways that third parties can integrate with us. Some of them are very lightweight, some of them are for a more sophisticated solution, larger integration costs, heavier weight solutions that give better control and better customer experience. So these third parties can choose depending on their level of sophistication, the size of the partner and so on.  

What we're doing is we are working to always enhance our toolset so that even the higher end integration efforts can be done with less friction. You can count on us to continue to work on that too.  

OPERATOR: Our next question is from GeraldSmith of J.P. Morgan.  

GERALDSMITH, ANALYST, J.P. MORGAN: We've seen your third party contribution to total unit sales increase dramatically, they are now comprising roughly 22 percent of worldwide unit sales. As a follow up to Mary Meeker's question, can you comment on the long-term target for mix between internally fulfilled products and your third party sales and the potential impact to your projected sales growth, given that while you generate higher margins on these sales, you're recognizing the sales on a net basis.  

JEFF BEZOS: We really don't have a particular target level for what that mix should be. Our point of view on that is that we should simply try to make both of those offerings the very, very best they can be for consumers, and then let customers decide what that mix should be.  

GERALDSMITH: And secondly, if you look at your domestic gross margins, they increase roughly 1 percent. Is that primarily driven by your third party sales? Finally, do you see the potential for your electronics and other categories seeing profitability by Q403, is that really a realistic objective still, and where do you stand there?  

JEFF BEZOS: North American margins, the increase in North American margins were driven by our strong media growth, our North American media was up 15 percent, which is certainly very strong compared to previous quarters, and that was driven by two things. Again, it was both our retail business, meaning Amazon as a seller, and third party. So we had great growth in both aspects and that is really what drove the operating margin growth within North America.  

In terms of your question around electronics and general merchandise, that's not really the way we look at our business. We look at our segments certainly our North American segment and international segment, we look at individual products within there but we don't really focus on individual categories. Again, we're trying to improve the profitability and the cash flow of all of our individual products that we offer.  

GERALDSMITH: Thank you.  

OPERATOR: We will take a question from Shawn Milne from SoundView.  

SHAWN MILNE, ANALYST, SOUNDVIEW TECHNOLOGY CORP.: Thank you very much. Just a quick question on rolling out new categories. Jeff, I wondered if you could talk a little about the experience now that you've got the sporting goods category up and running, and how it looks relative to the launch of apparel last year. Any learnings from the company, anything you can take forward to new categories? Thanks.  

JEFF BEZOS: It's certainly too early to report back on sporting goods. The basic learning is that we are trying to focus on having the right set of merchant partners so that we have a complete selection for customers and attractive prices for customers. One of the things that is very interesting about sporting goods in particular is that in the physical world, a sporting goods store that has breadth of selection, sort of a superstore concept, tends to have very shallow selection in any particular category. So that if you get into fly fishing or archery or badminton you don't have very good selection.  

So what we are trying to do is build a sporting goods store that has that breadth, but within each category has the depth that you might find in a specialist enthusiast store. So we are very excited about the customer experience that we think is possible in sporting goods at Amazon.com, but it's too early to report back on that.  

SHAWN MILNE: And just a quick follow-up on geographical growth. There's been some pretty positive data points coming out of Japan in terms of online growth. Can you give us an update there, and maybe dovetail that in with an overall Asian strategy in the next couple of years? Thanks, Jeff.  

JEFF BEZOS: I can't give you numbers on, specific numbers, on Japan since we don't break it out that way. I can tell you that we are very pleased with the Japanese business and the way that is going. That team is doing a great job. They are serving our Japanese customers at an extraordinarily high level and the business is growing very nicely. I really can't go beyond that.  

As for what we might do in the future in terms of new geographies, that is also something that we would like to continue with our practice of not preempting those kinds of things.  

SHAWN MILNE: Thank you.  

OPERATOR: We will take our final question today from Mark Rowen of Prudential. Please go ahead.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL EQUITY GROUP, INC.: Thank you. A couple of quick questions. Tom, number 1, on North American media the acceleration to 15 percent, could you be a little bit more specific about what caused that growth? Was it a specific product category? Books, music, movies, video games.  

And, can you give us a sense of how much of that was same-store sales versus taking over new stores for other companies?  

Related to that, international media products seemed to slow fairly significantly this quarter, even with the benefit of currency. Could you give us a sense of what is going on there?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. As it relates to the North American media, what is driving that is a lot of the things we've been talking about. It's again, lower prices, free shipping. We just had great growth again from Amazon as a seller and third parties. Again, our growth was 15 percent, it's the strongest growth we've had in North American media in several quarters and so again, you can see the acceleration there.  

In terms of international media growth, one thing that you are seeing there is clearly, particularly in the U.K. we've lowered prices and with the supersaver delivery certainly you are seeing the impact of that in the top line, so again we've aggressively lowered prices during the quarter as well as supersaver delivery, we are giving more to customers. That is showing up in the top line and the bottom line. We certainly think it's the right thing to do, but again, that's what you are seeing there.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay. And then finally, since third party is so important to you, I wonder if you could give us gross merchandise sales and revenue from third party sales?  

JEFF BEZOS: No, we haven't disclosed that, Mark, and we don't think it's appropriate to do so at this time.  

MARK ROWEN: Okay. Thanks very much.  

TIM STONE: Thanks, Mark. With that I want to thank everyone for joining us on our call today. As a reminder, a replay will be available on our investor relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter, and thanks for your interest in Amazon.com.  

OPERATOR: That does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect. [SI1]He did say 2004, I think he meant 2003

TOM SZKUTAK, SVP AND CFO, AMAZON.COM: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will discuss our financial and operating results and our outlook for Q3 in the remainder of the year. This was another great quarter for Amazon.com, as our customers continued to take advantage of our low prices and free shipping offers.  

First, a few highlights for the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis was $245m. The combination of common stock outstanding and employee stock-based awards increased 1 percent to 433m shares. Worldwide unit growth accelerated to 42 percent, providing meaningful benefit to our bottom line results.  

Third party units as a percentage of total units were 20 percent for the quarter, an increase from 14 percent. Units served excludes products sold by our partners on their websites. Revenues driven by free shipping offers and lower prices grew to a non-holiday quarter record of $1.1b, representing growth of 37 percent. Adjusting for the $55m favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange rates, revenue growth accelerated to 30 percent.  

Our North America segment revenues grew 20 percent to $703m, our North American electronics and other general merchandise growth rate increased to 36 percent and our media category revenue grew 14 percent.  

International segment revenues were $397m, an 81 percent increase. Adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, international revenue growth accelerated to 57 percent.  

Active customer accounts, those with purchases in the last 12 months, totalled $35m worldwide, a 27 percent increase. Consolidated segment operating income, which is consistent with pro forma operating income was $67m or 6 percent of sales, including a $3m benefit from foreign exchange rates. Our operating leverage was 14 percent, representing year-over-year incremental segment operating profit divided by incremental revenue.  

Pro forma net income, which includes interest expense, was $42m, or 10 cents per diluted share, compared to a loss of a penny per diluted share a year ago. Our GAAP net loss improved by $50m to $43m, or 11 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $94m, or 25 cents per share. The improvement was largely the result of a $40m increase in GAAP operating income.  

Three primary factors contributed to the remaining $10m net improvement in our GAAP net loss. First, the market-to-market related to our Euro-based debt was $33m lower. We had a $38m charge in the current quarter, compared with a $71m charge in the prior year.  

Second, in connection with our May 28th early redemption of our 10 percent senior discount notes, we incurred a $15m charge, consisting of a $13m redemption premium and $2m of unamortized debt issuance costs.  

Third, we incurred a $6m non-cash charge to terminate our swap agreement that hedged the foreign exchange rate risk on a portion of our Euro-based debt.  

Moving to our balance sheet, inventory was $178m at June 30, 2003, up from $127m and trailing 12 month inventory trends were 20, up from 19. We encourage you to compare these metrics to other world-class retailers.  

Our investment of fixed assets declined 11 percent from a year ago to $222m, while revenue units have grown substantially. This is difficult for a normal retailer to do, but we have the advantage of trading real estate for technology.  

Cash and marketable securities at the end of June increased $165m to $989m after paying $277m to redeem our 10 percent senior discount notes this quarter.  

Now I will discuss our operating results in more detail. Our primary long-term goal has been and continues to be to drive sustainable and significant amount of free cash flow. On a trailing 12 month basis, free cash flow reached $245m, an improvement of over $225m, driven by improvements in operating cash flow.  

When thinking about cash flows, let me remind you that operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors, including changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including world events, seasonality, the timing of expense payments, discounts offered by vendors, and vendor payment terms. You should expect that we may take advantage of offers from vendors when it's the right economic trade, such as discounts offered by vendors in exchange for early payment, but over time, fluctuations in working capital will even out.  

For example, our second quarter 2003 trailing 12-month operating cash flow and free cash flow were positively impacted by approximately $20m because, as reported last year, a credit card service provider unintentionally failed to make a scheduled quarter-end payment to us until the third quarter of 2002.  

And in the second quarter of 2003, we purchased and received customer payment for over $1.4m units of Harry Potter 5, for which payment was generally not due to our vendors until after second quarter of 2003.  

Trailing 12 month unit growth was up 38 percent, while consolidated segment operating expenses increased only 5 percent, resulting in an increase of over 350 basis points and consolidated segment operating margin.  

Every part of the company contributed to these results. In Japan, for example, which we opened two-and-a-half years ago, our sales have grown to the point where over the trailing 12 months we achieved a small operating profit. Our growth is being fuelled by the relentless focus on the primary inputs into customer experience; selection, convenience and price. I will briefly touch on each aspect.  

We continue to expand selection inside of existing countries and product categories. We launch consumer electronics in Japan earlier this month. We introduced kitchen and home stores in the U.K. and Germany. We launched software and video game stores in Canada. [Rico Camera] is offering their selection in the Amazon.com camera and photo store, and we expanded to over 1,000 brands in our apparel and accessory stores, more than double the more than 450 brands that launched last November.  

And there is more to come. We are currently building a number of new stores that we plan to open and promote later this year, and we expect to continue to add third party sellers to our worldwide websites who will join our more than 500,000 active seller accounts, those with orders from our customers in the last 12 months.  

We constantly strive to make the stores more convenient for our customers. One feature that we offer is pre-orders, through which customers can place their orders at their convenience in advance of the product's release. They rely on Amazon.com to deliver their items as soon as they are available.  

The most notable example this quarter was our delivery of Harry Potter 5 pre-orders. I would like to personally thank our retail, operations and customer service teams who worked with our suppliers and shipping partners to deliver on the commitments to customers around the world. Also, as a customer and father, my daughter and I would like to thank you for your great service. Operational highlights of our Harry Potter 5 delivery compared with Harry Potter 4 in July 2000 include the following.  

We delivered 1.4m copies worldwide, compared with over 400,000 three years ago. We shipped to over 175 countries, from Antarctica to Zimbabwe; we shipped to over 175 countries. U.K. distribution centres' peak through-put day was higher than their peak day in Q4 2002. We utilized specially designed boxes in the U.S., which were over two-thirds less expensive than the packaging we used for Harry Potter 4. Our automated U.S. packaging system was eight times more productive than the manual process we used three years ago.  

Our shipping costs were greatly reduced, partly due to our ability to use postal injection for over 50 percent of the books, a capability we didn't have in 2000. We've also offered Harry Potter 5 at an average discount from list price of over 40 percent worldwide since it became available for pre-order in January. On the product price alone, customers saved over $18m off list price in the quarter.  

Customers could elect guaranteed delivery on the Saturday, June 21st release date, at the standard delivery shipping rate. We are pleased we were able to provide Harry Potter 5 to customers worldwide at roughly our overall cost. It was essentially a contribution profit break even event which negatively impacted gross margin and operating margin, although from a long-term investment perspective it was an effective new customer acquisition vehicle with over 250,000 new customer accounts trusting Amazon.com for the first time.  

We continue to relentlessly lower prices to create the best value proposition for our customers. Let me be clear. At Amazon.com, lowering prices worldwide is not an event, it is the way we run our business. Our pricing objective is not to discount a small number of products for a limited period of time, but to offer low prices every day and apply them broadly across our entire product range.  

Recently, for example, in addition to product price savings on Harry Potter 5 and electronics and other general merchandise, we lowered prices on thousands of products last quarter. Free shipping offers around the world again saved customers tens of millions of dollars this quarter, which we consider a marketing investment even though it is captured as part of gross profit, and today we lowered our U.K. free super saver delivery order side to L25 from L39.  

Remember too that we offer 30 percent off books over $15, whereas many book superstores only discount their top sellers. And even on top sellers in our January comparison of product-only prices with a major well known U.S. chain of book superstores, our prices were 23 percent lower than their store prices on their published list of 100 bestsellers for 2002. I encourage you to compare these prices for yourselves with your favourite physical world bookstore and tell your friends, because it takes a long time to educate tens of millions of people about anything, even that they are not spending wisely.  

As we've said before, you certainly may find reasons to shop in the physical world - for instance, if you need something immediately, but please realize you will be paying more. We believe our ability to lower prices and expand selection while simultaneously improving customer experience globally is a unique opportunity and this past quarter offers further evidence that the strategy is working and that customers are starting to realize they will save a significant amount of money and time when they shop at Amazon.com.  

The combination of continuous improvement in customer experience, ever expanding selection, the great value proposition to our customers which includes low prices, great convenience and free shipping; our eagerness to share our prime product detail pages with third parties; and the foundations of our model which leverages technology versus real estate will enable future growth and allow us to generate significant amounts of free cash flow over time.  

I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance for Q3 and an update to our baseline expectations for the year. Incorporated into Q3 guidance and full year expectations are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, we also recognize we are lapsing our prior year price reduction, particularly free shipping, and there is a high level of uncertainty surround fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the global economy, consumer spending and the impact on both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  

Also, when we think about growth we are concerned with the long-term growth in free cash flow. That is ultimately how we will measure our success. For the September quarter we expect net sales of between $1.075b and $1.15b, or growth between 26 percent and 35 percent year over year. We expect our consolidated segment operating profit to be between $55m and $70m. For calendar 2003, our expectations are, net sales are expected to be between $4.9b and $5.1b, or to grow between 25 percent and 30 percent. We expect consolidated segment operating profit to be between $300m and $340m and over 150 basis points improvement in operating margin year over year. We expect a reinvestment ratio, or capital expenditures divided by depreciation, to be less than one. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates to stay approximately where they have been recently. We cannot predict fluctuations in the Euro, Pound, Yen or Canadian Dollar.  

Also remember that since last year we have significantly improved our free shipping offers worldwide. For example, in the back half of Q3 2002 we lowered the U.S. free super saver shipping threshold from $49 to $25. Let me also remind everyone that since certain stock awards are subject to variable accounting, which are not cash, charge or gain for any movement in our share price between reporting dates, and we mark our Euro denominated debt to March at the end of each quarter, which results in a non-cash gain or loss for any movement in the Euro between reporting dates.  

We also have exposure to the Euro related to our unhedged interest expense on this euro denominated debt. Therefore, we cannot forecast these items yet they could have a significant impact, either positively or negatively on our results.  

Looking forward for the next several years, we will focus on further improving our customer experience, continually challenging ourselves on whether we are delivering the best possible customer experience. We will be on the leading edge of technology and innovation. We've been investing over $200m a year in technology and content and still think there is a lot more innovation in our next eight years than in the eight years since Amazon.com opened in July of 1995. Our growth in existing countries, and as we expand to additional countries, will continually be driven by increased selection in new and existing categories, including more third party sellers, greater convenience, and lower prices.  

Beyond the customer benefit of all of these, our technology and fixed infrastructure and other operating costs will also continue to scale, declining as a percentage of revenue while growing in absolute dollars.  

We will continue to drive further productivity internally, and lower per unit costs of what we call deflation with our external suppliers. We believe these initiatives, combined with the advantages of our model will lead to high returns on investment capital and sustainable growth and free cash flow.  

Before opening up to questions, let me close with a final, two brief thoughts. First, in addition to the inherent benefits of shopping online, we are creating a unique experience for our global customers. We are determined to offer world-leading customer experiences and the lowest possible prices.  

Finally, customer experience comes first at Amazon.com and we believe that that approach drives the best long term returns for our shareholders. Thanks, and with that, Tim, let's move to questions.  

TIM STONE: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move onto the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. In the interest of allowing as many people as possible to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question. Operator, if you can remind our listeners how to ask a question, we will proceed.  

OPERATOR: (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from [Jeetil Patel] with Deutsche Bank Securities.  

JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Great quarter, guys. A couple of questions. Free shipping continues to pay off in boosting unit volumes for active customers, and it still seems like you are seeing a double digit increase in units per active customer. Do you think that is sustainable? Is that something we should look for in the second half of this year?  

And secondly, can you talk about I guess free shipping in the U.K. is continuing and coming down in terms of the hurdle rate, it seems like you have revved even faster internationally in general relative to the U.S. business. How should we think about the ROI as it relates to free shipping internationally, and particularly in the U.K. and maybe other markets as you do it there, relative to the U.S.  

Finally, I guess, third party development. Can you talk about how it may be different in the international markets versus the U.S. markets? How it is developing, kind of ramping up in general?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Just a broad answer on free shipping. First of all, as we've disclosed before, very expensive, but we think certainly our customers like it and we are seeing some very, very positive results. It certainly takes a lot of time to educate customers both on free shipping and on the price decreases that we've had over time. So again, those things it is difficult to say looking forward how long that will continue, but again we think it really takes a long time to educate customers.  

As far as the U.K., we are certainly very pleased to be able to announce that we are lowering our threshold to L25 today. That is really a result from the success we've had globally. So again, you should expect that it is something that is certainly a significant investment for us but we think it is the right thing to do, and it has helped us to accelerate growth.  

As far as the third party, if you can just clarify the third party question again?  

JEETIL PATEL: Yes, can you talk about how it's developing internationally in Germany and U.K. relative to the U.S. market in the trend's interesting or different relative to the domestic ramp-up that we saw over the past couple years?  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. It's really early to be able to compare the two regions, but we are very pleased with the progress. We certainly have a long way to go, but we're very pleased with the progress we've seen to date globally.  

TIM STONE: Great. Thanks [indiscernible]. Next question, Operator.  

OPERATOR: Your next question is from [Anthony Noto] with Goldman Sachs.  

ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much. First question is on international. As I look at the profitability in absolute dollars of the international segment, it looks like you had about $12.6 million in operating profit in the second quarter versus 15.8 in the first. Sequentially your revenue from Q1 to Q2 actually increased $19m. Now four million of that sequentially is from inter-currency benefit from what I can tell. And I just wonder if you could talk about the profitability change internationally, especially since Japan was [inaudible] quarter, net of the currency changes.  

And then secondly, your unit growth continues to accelerate and you benefit from the price reduction and free shipping. And if I go back in time and compare your gross profit growth to your revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, it looks like in the fourth quarter of 2002 was the first time in several quarters, since you started doing marketplace and free shipping and price reductions, that your revenue growth actually grew faster year-over-year than your gross profit growth, which indicates to me that that was the first time that the benefits from the promotional lower pricing strategy actually drove faster unit growth than the reduction in revenue per transaction based on the mix shift. And now we've seen that for three quarters in a row. Do you [inaudible] continue as the benefit in light of the fact of the price promotion and low pricing strategy kicks in and becomes more broadly known because that seems like it's an inflection point that's sustainable now.  

And then lastly on free cash flow -- why can't it be more than $320m this year and what do you plan on using with the cash? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. First, to answer your question, Anthony, on international margins, just a little bit of background -- we're very please with the progress we've made in international. This is the first time on a [inaudible] month basis we exceeded a billion and a half on sales on a trailing 12-month basis. Our operating margins on a trailing 12-month basis are approximately three percent or $49m versus a year ago -- it was minus three percent, minus $29m. Again, on a trailing 12-month basis we've made significant progress.  

In the quarter -- again, we've seen substantial growth year-over-year -- operating profit up three percent. We talked about the revenue growth up 81 percent -- adjusted for FX it's up 57 percent. That compares to last year from an operating profit in a standpoint of flat basically. Again, we're very pleased with the progress and our segment operating profit as well.  

When you look sequentially from first quarter to second quarter, you obviously have to take into consideration we had Harry Potter V. We also introduced new shipping offers in the first quarter as well that's impacting that sequentially has it's had in other markets as we've done that. But again, in generally with our international segment, we're very, very pleased.  

In terms of unit growth -- your question on unit growth, if you could just repeat that again or at least a portion of that again, it'd be great.  

ANTHONY NOTO: Yes. Sorry about that. It's a long question. Essentially, as you lowered prices and gave free shipping, you saw a decline in your revenue per transaction. It was very hard to see your real underlying revenue growth, and one way to actually detect that was looking at gross profit growth. And it wasn't until the fourth quarter of 2002 that your revenue growth year-over-year actually grew faster than your gross profit growth after that transition started, which means your unit growth actually started to grow fast enough to off-set the declining revenue per transaction from the mix shift and the type of revenue you reported and it's now stayed that way for three consecutive quarters. And I'm just trying to understand if that's something that's now [inaudible] changed and stabilized and that your unit growth will continue to be faster than the decline in revenue per transaction on the mix shift from the marketplace business relative to the regular retail business.  

TOM SZKUTAK: It's a very good question. It certainly -- there's so many different factors that are driving each of our individual quarters. It's really [inaudible] as you could probably appreciate to pinpoint any specific item, if that makes sense.  

In terms of your question on the free cash flow -- we certainly haven't given guidance for the total year. We're certainly pleased with the performance we've seen, in a trailing 12-month basis, as I've mentioned. It was also helped by Harry Potter, as I talked about. It was also helped by the $20m unusual that I also referred to in the script. Again, I think -- again, we're very, very pleased. We're continually focused on are the inputs that drive pro [inaudible] and costs out and combined with our model, we think that we'll be able to generate significant cash flow over time. But again, you should expect it to be a little bit choppy from quarter to quarter, as it has been. And again, as you can see this quarter, it's also choppy. We're pleased with the performance. It is, again, a little bit choppy.  

TIM STONE: Great. Thanks, Anthony. Operator, next question.  

OPERATOR: Your next question is from [Mary Meeker] with Morgan Stanley.  

MARY MEEKER, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks. Brian and I just have a couple questions also about unit growth. It looks like the 42 percent unit growth in the June quarter was the faster rate of unit growth you've had since we've been tracking it. I think it was about 39 percent year-to-year in the third quarter of '02. And one of the things that we're trying to figure out -- and this kind of ties in with Anthony's question, is you've given revenue guidance and operating income guidance for calendar '03. Could you give us a sense of what your unit growth assumptions might be and also, there's obviously a correlation with the increase in the third party mix as a percent of total revenue, to give us a sense of unit growth forecasts for '03 and also third-party mix that would be great. I know it's a hard thing to do, but any qualified statements there would be great. Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks, Mary. We really have not provided in the past unit growth guidance. And it is very difficult to forecast. Our customers will decide also the mix as we go forward. You can see the trends over the last several quarters that [inaudible] that I think are helpful. But as we continue to grow and add new selection each quarter -- and again we're adding new selection each quarter, we're working on a number of new categories right now that we'll be launching between now and the end of the year. Again, all those factors, as well as what our customers want, are going to dictate that. It's extremely difficult to do that.  

MARY MEEKER: Well, Tom, could you maybe give us a sense for the June quarter what the largest needle mover. Could you maybe give us a sense, Tom, or Tim for the June quarter, what the [inaudible] mover was, if you will, in driving up unit growth? Was it apparel? Was it pre-owned stuff? Was it just basic marketplace stuff? Where there [inaudible] that were especially strong? Was it Harry Potter?  

TOM SZKUTAK: We've certainly -- we've disclosed the Harry Potter numbers. Harry Potter was 1.4 million units for the quarter. But beyond that, it was really, Mary, more of the same, more of the same -- more of the things we've been talking about over the last several quarters. It was the lower pricing, free shipping. We continued to add great selection. All those things contributed and really helped drive unit growth. It's really the total focus on customer experience.  

MARY MEEKER: Thanks, guys.  

[indiscernible]  

JEFFREY P. BEZOS, PRESIDENT, CEO AND CHAIRMAN, AMAZON.COM: If we look at what are the things -- knowing everything we know now, one of the things we wish we had done earlier is put in place this testing program that we did on free shipping and figuring out what the right level to do that is. And what you see us doing today in the U.K., for example, is an attempt to get ahead of that curve and do that very rapidly. That certainly continues to be a driver of the unit growth you see, when combined with the very, very sharp pricing that our team has put in place. It's the combination of the free shipping with the low product prices and you can expect to see us continue to work very hard on that. And, of course, it wasn't just the will to do it, which we had to figure out how to do and how to structure it and so on, but it was also the ability to afford it -- to be able to have the cost structure that economically supported this level of free shipping and this level of low prices. But when you can do that, customers respond to it. And that's really what you're seeing in terms of driving the unit growth. You can do the math on Harry Potter V and see that it's a very small percentage of what's going on. We're very fortunate there are no single products which account for a big percentage of our revenues. I think that's a big driver.  

And then there will be other things having to do with the other aspects of customer experience over time that will continue to drive these kind of results we hope. I mean that's what we're trying to do and it's lower prices. It's increased selection. It's things having to do with different tools on the Web sites -- make it easier for people to find what they're looking for. Every single aspect that we know that customers care about we're determined to improve those things [inaudible] year in and year out. And one of the pleasant things in this quarter that we're all happy about is the acceleration in our electronics and general merchandise or the kitchen tools and so on. That category is doing very well. And we think part of what's going on there is -- it takes time to educate customers about new offerings. But you reach -- at a certain point you reach a kind of a critical mass where it starts to build on itself, and whether we're there yet or not for electronics, we won't be able to tell you until afterwards. So we don't really know for sure. But we certainly like the progress that we see in those new categories, too.  

MARY MEEKER: Great. Thanks a lot.  

TIM STONE: Thank you, Mary. Operator, next question. And if you could remind everyone as well to limit your questions to one.  

OPERATOR: Your next question is from [Mark Rowen] with Prudential.  

MARK ROWEN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL: Thank you. Could you give us a sense of how much cross benefit you got from Harry Potter? In other words, how many people came to the site to order that book and then ordered other things that were related to that book? And then, if I assume about a million of those 1.4 million were in the U.S., it looks like your U.S. media business grew at about nine percent. Is that about the right number and would you expect single digit growth in that segment for the rest of the year? Thank you.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Mark, to answer your first question on cross shopping -- there's certainly -- we did have attachments to those orders, and we're hoping, obviously, going forward with the new customers or customer accounts that participated that they'll reorder again. Again, we haven't disclosed what those particular numbers are related to cross shopping, but again, it was a -- we're very pleased with the results of Harry Potter V in general.  

In terms of the units, we did release, during the month of June, what the pre-orders were related to Harry Potter V. We haven't released anything since in terms of the split by geography and we're planning to do that on this call. But again, if you take a look at North America in general, we're very pleased with the performance of North American media. It was up 14 percent. Our unit growth was up substantially higher than 14 percent during the quarter. Again, we're very pleased with that performance. We continue to take share from off-line retailers and again, we're pleased with the progress we've made there.  

TIM STONE: Well, good. Thanks very much, Mark. Next question, Operator.  

OPERATOR: Your next question is for -- is from [Safa Rashtchy] with Piper Jaffray.  

SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY: Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. If I can, I'd like to just step back a little bit and just look at the broader e-commerce market and get your thoughts, Jeff, in particular, but also, Tom, on how you see that growth affecting yours. What we have been seeing is suddenly not accelerating growth [inaudible] from some accounts -- possibly decelerating growth and yet your -- increasing growth rate. I guess the conclusion would be your taking market share or expanding in categories. Can you maybe, at the top level, talk about how you see your growth compared to the market? And also, in terms of the operating margin expansion, how much of that 14 percent incremental operating margin that you're seeing can be sustained towards your long-term goal and possibly increasing that goal and how much is third-party contributing to that? Thank you.  

JEFFREY P. BEZOS: Well, our opinion on the kind of the e-commerce landscape, as a whole, is that it is still very, very early days. I still believe very strongly that this is a landscape that is going to create lots of winners. I think there are going to be lots of companies that do very well in e-commerce. I think that we are -- what's driving our results is very, very clear. It is improvements in customer experience -- the things I was speaking of earlier in terms of lower prices, better selection, faster delivery times and so on and so on. You can just go right down the line. But this is -- I still believe that over ten plus years that this will grow to be 10 to 15 percent of retail. And so we have the good fortune, along with other folks who operate in e-commerce, of operating in what is basically a market size, unconstrained opportunity. I mean hopefully, at some point, it would be -- hopefully, at some point, we'll be market size constrained, but that's a long way away because these are big numbers and this is still very, very, very early days.  

TIM STONE: Great. Thanks very much, Satha. Operator, next question please.  

OPERATOR: Your next question is from [Laney Baker] with Smith Barney.  

BILL MORRISON, ANALYST, SMITH BARNEY: Hi. It's actually Bill Morrison for Laney. Congratulations. I've just got a question about your revenue guidance. If I take your third quarter and full year -- kind of the mid-point of your third quarter and full year guidance, I'm getting to an implied revenue growth in the fourth quarter of around 18 percent off of 28 percent this -- in the third quarter -- 36 percent this quarter. Just wondering why you didn't maybe raise your full year guidance. Just seems a little bit light and whether there's a reason for that or something we're missing. Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, we actually did raise our total year guidance and we raised our second half guidance as a result of this call. We're certainly cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year. That being said, we're also overlapping some of the shipping offers from last year. We went to -- in late August of last year, we went from $49.00 down to 25 in Amazon.com. So we had that for the rest of the quarter. Certainly visibility to the end of the year can be difficult based on that. Currency -- certainly, we expect that currency is going to be positive for the second half of the year -- tens of millions of dollars included in guidance for that. But there certainly uncertainty around that as well. Again, while we're cautiously optimistic, we're working on, we think the right things. We think that the guidance is appropriately conservative and right for our business.  

BILL MORRISON: Great. Thanks a lot.  

OPERATOR: Your next question is from [Heath Terry] with Credit Suisse First Boston.  

HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: Great. I was wondering if you could just kind of talk generally about the competitive environment and how that's changed as you -- over the last quarter or so -- obviously, the news about AOL maybe -- and I realize it's kind of shady as to what exactly the plan is there. But as you see -- how do you see the competitive environment changing, clearly, especially as you partner with some of the companies that might be competitors down the road.  

JEFFREY P. BEZOS: I think that the -- we have a long-standing practice of not speaking about particular other companies and we'll certainly continue that practice. The fact is that, in this particular arena, the competitive environment has always been an intense one and I think -- I would not forecast a change there.  

HEATH TERRY: Okay. Thanks.  

TIM STONE: Okay. Thanks. Operator, let's make this our last question, please.  

OPERATOR: Okay. Your final question then comes from [Shawn Milne] of [indiscernible].  

SHAWN MILNE, ANALYST: Thanks a lot. Tom, I just wanted to follow up on the operating leverage comment. If you look in the quarter, you talked about 14 percent operating leverage, but you suggested that Harry Potter was a breakeven event on about -- I did the math -- about 25 million in sales. If we backed that out, operating leverage would have been, give or take 15, 16 percent. Your guidance for Q3, if I use the midpoint, is only 14 percent. Is there some incremental spending in Q3 or is that conservatism? Thanks.  

TOM SZKUTAK: Well, certainly as we look at operating leverage, we're trying to balance -- we're continually trying to recruit new software development engineers focused on improving the customer experience. So certainly going forward we expect to be doing that in the second half of the year and beyond. I'm not going to comment specifically what we think operating leverage will do, but, obviously, we had mentioned that we're working on a number of new stores. That certainly will impact the second half operating leverage as we open those new stores. Certainly you should expect that that will be a drag. And so those are some of the key points that you should think about as you look at our second half guidance.  

SHAWN MILNE: Thank you.  

TIM STONE: Real good. Well thank you for joining us on this afternoon's call. As a reminder, a replay will be available on our investor relations Web site at least through the end of the quarter. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thanks for your interest in Amazon.com.  

JEFFREY P. BEZOS: Thank you.

 OPERATOR: Good afternoon, my name is Amy and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amazon.com financial conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. If you would like to ask a question during this time press star and the number one on the telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw, your question, press star and the number 2. Thank you. Now I will turn the conference over to Tim Halladay, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 

 TIM HALLADAY, VICE PRESIDENT OF INVESTOR RELATIONS, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Good afternoon and welcome to the Amazon.com first quarter 2003 conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Tom Szkutak, Jeff Bezos, our CEO will be available for the Q&A portion of the call. 

   TD
 Please keep in mind that the following discussion and responses to your questions as of today April 24, 2003 only and will include forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Additional information about factors that could potentially affect Amazon.com financial result is included in today's press release and the Company's filings of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Includes in the Annual Report on the form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2002 and all subsequent filings. 

 As you listen to today's call I encourage you to have the press release in front of you, since all financial results and as well as commentaries for the quarter are included and will correspond to much of the discussion that follows. During this call, we will also present certain non-GAAP financial measures in the release which is posted on the Investor Relations website at Amazon.com you will find reconciliations of these measures with GAAP. Pro forma and other non-GAAP results are included for the benefit of the investors. Unless otherwise stated all comparisons used in this call will be against our results from the comparable period of 2002. 

 With that introduction I will turn the call over to Tom. 

 TOM SZKUTAK, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. This was a great quarter for Amazon.com as our customers took advantage of lower prices and free shipping offers. I would like to talk about four things today. First a few highlights of the quarter, second a execution of our model, third our financial results in greater detail and fourth our outlook for Q2 and the remainder of 2003. 

 First, a few highlights for the quarter. Driven by lower prices in the success of our free shipping offers, revenues reached a non-holiday record of $48 million, representing growth of 28% year over year. Adjusting for the year over year revenue growth for the quarter was 22%. World wide units even faster at 35%, providing meaningful benefit to our bottom line results. Our North American segment revenues grew 13% to $705 million with unit growth of 28%. International segment revenues were $379 million, a 68% year over year increase, on unit growth of 52%. Consolidating segment operating profit, which is consistent with the past measure of pro forma operating profit was $67 million or 6.2% of sales including a $4 million benefit from foreign exchange rate. Pro forma net income which includes interest expense was $40 million, which is 10 per share compared to a loss of a penny a share a year ago. Active customer accounts, those with purchases in the last 12 months sold 33 million, a 26% year over year increase. Third party units, as a percentage of units served, were 19% for the quarter, an increase from 13% one year ago. Free cash flow on a 12 month basis was $123 million, a year over year improvement in excess of $100 million. The combination of common stock outstanding and employee stock based awards decreased 1% year over year. 

 Second, I'd like to spend a minute how Amazon.com is unique relative to other retailers. A concept Jeff discussed recently in his annual letter to shareholders. In many ways, Amazon.com is not a normal store. We have deep selection that is unconstrained by shelf space. We turn our inventory twenty times in a year. We personalize the store for each and every customer. We trade real state for technology, which gets cheaper and more capable every year. We display customer reviews critical of our products. You can make a purchase with a few seconds and one click. We put used products next to new ones, so you can choose. We share our prime real estate product detailed pages with third parties and if they can offer better value, we let them. 

 One of our most exciting differences is poorly understood. People see we are determined to offer leading experience in the low possible prices. Traditional stores face a time tested trade off between offering high touch customer experience on the one hand and the lowest possible prices on the other. How can Amazon.com be trying to do both? The answer is that we transform much of the customer experience such as unmatched selection, extensive product information, personalized recommendations and other new software features into largely a fixed expense. With customer experience cost largely fixed, more like a publishing model than retail, our costs as a percentage of sales can shrink rapidly as we grow our business. More over, customer experience costs remain variable, such as the variable portion of fulfillment costs, improve in our model as we reduce defects. Eliminating defects improves our cost position and leads to better customer experience. 

 We believe our ability to lower cost and simultaneously drive customer service is a big deal and this past quarter offers evidence that the strategy is working. While delivering 35% more units to customers, we delivered our best ever experience. Cycle time, the amount of time taken by our North American fulfillment centers to process an order improved 7% compared to last year. In one of our most important measures of customer satisfaction, contact per order saw a 12% improvement worldwide. 

 Inside existing product categories and countries we worked hard to increase selection. Electronic selection is up over 26% in the U.S. alone over the prior year and we now offer over ten times the selection of typical big box electronic store. Even in U.S. books where we've been working for eight years, we increased selection by 12%, mostly in harder to find and out of print titles. Outside the U.S., selection from U.K., Germany, French and Canadian sites has increased in excess of 50% year over year and of course, we've added new categories. Our accessory store has 500 top clothing brands and earlier this month, we launched Home and Kitchen in the U.K. and Germany. In Q1 we added tens of thousands of third party sellers, that made their products available at Amazon.com. And on this year's American Customer Satisfaction Index, the most authoritative study on customer satisfaction, Amazon.com scored an 88, the highest score ever reported not just online, not just in retailing but the highest score ever recorded in any service industry. While focused on customer experience, we've also lowered prices substantially over the last several years. We have done so broadly across product categories, from books to electronics and we've eliminated shipping fees with year round free super saver shipping with orders over $25. We've also been taking similar actions in every country in which we do business. Our pricing objective is not to discount a small number of books for a limited period of time, but to offer low prices every day and apply them broadly across our entire product range. To illustrate this point, we did a price comparison back in January versus a major well-known chain of book superstores. For purposes of the comparison, we used their published list of 100 best sellers for 2002 and determined that purchasing those books at Amazon.com verses their stores resulted in savings for the customer of 23%. To be sure you may find reasons to shop in the physical world. For instance, if you need something immediately but please realize you'll be paying a premium. If you want to save money and time, you'll do better by shopping at Amazon.com. 

 What does this mean to shareholders? The combination of continuous experience in customer experience, ever expanding selection, the great value proposition to our customers, which includes low prices, great convenience and free shipping, our willingness to share prime real estate with third parties and foundation of our model which leverages technology versus real estate will allow us to generate returns on investment capital and significant amounts of free cash flow over time. 

 Let's move on to the third topic, a detailed look at quarterly results. Net sales this quarter increased 28% while consolidated segment operating expenses increased only 2% year over year. There wasn't any individual group within the company that drove results, instead it was every part of the company. Fulfillment as a percentage of revenue was in the single digits for the first time at a non-holiday quarter at 9.6%, a greater than 100 basis point improvement from a year ago. Marketing costs declined in absolute dollars by 12% while we increased funding to the most efficient marketing channel. Remember also, our biggest expenditure for the year is our investment in free shipping which captures part of gross profit. Technology and content costs decline 10% in absolute dollars year over year. Although we benefited from reduced cost of hardware and tele cost capacity, our engineers are doing a terrific job of innovating and driving efficiencies in development of our website and the software that runs our backend systems. Partially off setting these savings, we have been aggressively continuing to invest in software development engineers to improve our customer experience. G&A was less than 2% of revenue in the quarter, a decline of over 50 basis points. The result was a 2% or $5 million increase in segment operating expenses but a decline as a percentage of revenue of more than 450 basis points. Consolidated segment operating profit improved $43 million to $67 million reaching an operating margin for the quarter of 6.2%. Our net loss for the quarter was $10 million or 3 cents per share compared to a net loss of $23 million or 6 cents per share in the prior year. 

 For the quarter there were three key differences year over year. First, we incurred a stock based compensation charge of $27 million in Q1 2003, primarily due to a $21 million charge for the upward movement of our stock price compared to an $11 million charge in 2002. Second, we had a $22 million net charge in the current quarter, primarily related to the mark to market debt compared to a $6 million benefit in the prior year. Third, we had a $10 million restructuring charge last year with no corresponding charge in the current year. In total these items negatively impacted GAAP results in the current quarter by $49 million compared to $15 million in the prior year. First quarter pro forma net income was $40 million or 10 cents per share compared to a loss of a penny a share a year ago. Free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis reached $123 million, an improvement of $110 million year over year. When thinking about operating and free cash flow, let me remind you that predicting elements of working capital at a specific point in time can be volatile and subject to many variables including world events, seasonality, the timing of accrued expenses, and discounts offered by vendors in exchange for early payment. You should expect that we may take advantage of offers from vendors when its the right economic trade but overtime fluctuations of working capital will even out. Our primary long-term goal has been and continues to be to drive sustainable and significant amounts of free cash flow. Ultimately we will measure our success by the progress we make toward our objective of generating significant free cash flow. 

 Let me move to asset efficiency. Inventory was $173 million at March 31, 2003 up from $139 million a year ago. Inventory turns were 20 on a trailing 12 month basis, a improvement of 13% year over year. We encourage you to compare this metric to other world class retailers. Our investment success has declined 11 percent from a year ago to $228 million and continues to scale as revenues grew 28% and units grew 35%. This is difficult for a normal retailer to do, but we have the advantage of trading real estate for technology. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $1.08 million or more than $335 million above a year ago. Today we announced we will use some of this cash in the second quarter to redeem our 10% senior discount notes which are not due until 2008. The redemption price is $270 million which includes a $13 million or 5% premium over the principle amount of the note. The premium will result in a charge to our second quarter GAAP results. This early redemption will have an insignificant impact of Q2 free cash flow but favorable impact on all future years through 2008. 

 I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance to Q2 and an update to our baseline expectations for 2003. Looking forward over the next several years, we'll continue to have growth driven by increasing selection within existing categories, category and country expansion, the addition of third party sellers and lower prices. Beyond the customer benefit of all these, our technology and fixed infrastructure will also continue to decline as a percentage of revenue. We'll continue to drive further productivity internally at a lower per unit cost or what we call "deflation" with our external suppliers. We believe that growth and cost initiatives that we have in place will lead to sustainable growth in free cash flow. 

 For 2003 incorporated into our Q2 guidance and for your expectations are the order trends we've seen to date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, we also recognize there's a high level of uncertainty surrounding the global economy, consumer spending and the impact of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic, it is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Also when thinking about growth we are concerned with only one thing, long-term growth and free cash flow. For the June quarter we expect sales to be between $1 billion and $1.05 billion, our growth of between 24-30%. As you would expect this measures foreign currency rates to be approximately where they are today, we cannot predict currency fluctuations going forward. We expect our consolidated segment operating profit to be between $45 million and $60 million. When comparing this with a year ago, please remember that this guidance incorporates $25 free super saver shipping for the entire quarter versus $99 for the majority of the prior year. For calendar year 2003, our baseline expectations are net sales are expected to be $4.7 billion or more to grow over 19%. We expect consolidated segment operating profit to be $275 million or more. 

 Let me remind everyone, since certain stock options are subject to variable accounting, we incur non-cash gains for movement between reporting dates. Also we mark our debt to market at the end of each quarter. The result will be a non-cash gain or loss. Therefore we cannot forecast either of these items, yet they could have a significant impact either positively or negatively on GAAP results. 

 Before opening up to questions, let me close with a final few thoughts. First and for most we have the opportunity to create the unique experience of our customers. We thank our customers for taking advantage of our selection, convenience and low pricing and the experience will only continue to get better. Second, our model is validating itself as we reach the benefit of scale. While we continue to invest in low prices and unit growth, we will work hard both internally, to increase productivity, and externally with our suppliers. Ultimately we will measure our success by the progress we make towards the objective of generating free cash flow. Finally all of us at Amazon.com have the same objective, we are collectively driven to deliver for both our customers and shareholders. We strive to always put the customer experience first, we believe that approach provides the best results for our shareholders. Thanks, and with that Tim, let's move to questions. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks, Tom. With that we'll move on to the Q&A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. In the interest of allowing as many as possible to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, if you could remind our listeners how to ask their questions, we'll proceed with the call. 

 OPERATOR: At this time if you would like to ask a question, press star then the number 1 on the telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Anthony Noto with Goldman Sachs. 

 ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you and good afternoon. In looking through the detailed analysis of your gross margins, it appears your international gross margin are about 22%, and domestic about 27 if I got that right. I was wondering what drivers do you think could move the international gross margin to 27% from 22 which would have a meaningful impact and how do you see that progressing over time. 

 Secondly you talked about launching new categories, when will we hear about those as we approach the summer time period and preholiday season. And lastly, Tom, just one book keeping thing, you did about $68 million in operating income the first quarter. Midpoint through your second quarter guidance $52 million. Given the seasonality is flat through the third, sort of implies 100 million in fourth, do you plan on spending a lot in the fourth quarter? Thanks. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. Thanks for the questions. The first question on gross margin, the way we look at it in the international segment, as you can appreciate we had super saver shipping and many free shipping offers in many countries since our existence. As we continue to get scale in those countries, we think we'll get better prices with our suppliers. That will evolve over time. We obviously look at gross margins but we're even more concerned about our operating margins and if you look at our international business, we made considerable progress there. Our operating margins as a percentage of sales last year first quarter were negative 5% and percentage of sales this quarter were plus 4% as a percentage of revenue. We look at gross margins, more concerned with segment operating profit and, again we think we'll see continuous improvement over time. 

 JEFFREY BEZOS, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, CEO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: I'll add to that on the international side, we still do a lot of purchasing through wholesalers and other kinds of distribution. As our volumes in those countries increase, we'll be able to continue to do a lot of volume through distribution but have a larger fraction of our volume be direct purchases and that has a very positive impact on gross margins over the long-term. 

 ANTHONY NOTO: Sounds like the gross margin changes internationally will follow a similar path to the U.S. with direct purchasing and other sort of [INAUDIBLE]. 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: It should follow similar trend, whether it will be the same levels or not in the long-term is still too early to know. They should go in that same direction. And then with respect to new product categories, we will be launching new product categories. I don't want to change our long standing practice of not preannouncing what we're going to be doing or exactly when. So you'll have to stay tuned with us there. We were hard at work on that right now and have been for some time. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: The last question surrounding Q2 and the rest of the year in terms of guidance, a question more on the total year of Q2 incident. 

 ANTHONY NOTO: I'm sorry, you basically guided to $275 million for the year. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: Yeah. 

 ANTHONY NOTO: Back out the first quarter and the implied midpoint in the second quarter and the assumption third quarter is sequentially is similar, that means fourth quarter is going to be flat to a year ago which seems a heck of a lot of upside or you're spending somewhere what we don't know about. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: Yeah, certainly uncertainty as we look out for the rest of the year. Guidance for top line was $4.7 billion in revenue or greater. As well as segment operating profits of $275 million or greater. Again, we think based on what we're seeing to date, our Q2 guidance is appropriate. Again, we think there's uncertainty out there, we're not, you know again, that's why we put the guidance in place. We think it's the right place for us to be. 

 ANTHONY NOTO: Thanks, very much. 

 OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Darryl Smith with J.P. Morgan. 

 DARRYL SMITH, ANALYST, J.P. MORGAN: Good afternoon. Quick question. It seems you have to walk a fine line from the retail business and market place revenues. Given your need to drive values over the distribution network, with what can you do to ensure that marketplace does not cannibalize your traditional retail business and how big of a concern is that for you? 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: What we've found when we've looked at this is that customers who buy in the marketplace offerings actually has a positive impact on new purchases as well. We don't, it's always hard to know for sure, we don't see any reason to be worried about cannibalization. We think what it does, what the market business does is improve significantly the customer experience. And so you get more of the customer wallet share and so on. 

 DARRYL SMITH: Second question is, can you talk about the marketing plans in terms of television, internet and free advertising [ INAUDIBLE ] decreasing year over year? 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: Our best marketing dollars although they're not captured in the marketing line are when we return dollars to customers in the foremost, super saver shipping, aggressive low product prices you see us offering, you saw us start this two years ago, aggressively discounting books 50% or more, 30% off. Very sharp pricing in the electronics store starting a year ago, we are doing more and more of that. Free super saver shipping, the $25 threshold started late August so there have been -- even though they are not capturing the marketing line, we consider that to be very effective use of the dollars. Then we continue to do a lot of very effective marketing in measurable ways online, for example, with our associates program where we buy ad placements from third parties online. 

 DARRYL SMITH: Great. Thanks. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Operator can we take the next question please. 

 OPERATOR: Next question comes from Shawn Milne of Soundview Technology. 

 SHAWN MILNE, ANALYST, SOUNDVIEW TECHNOLOGY: Thanks a lot, and congratulations on a good quarter. Tom, just a couple of quick questions. Can you talk about sequential pattern at all for the quarter? Did you see any impact from the war at the end of March, wouldn't appear so given the good solid guidance but I wonder if you could add color to that and follow up on, if you could talk a little bit about operating productivity and your goals for driving that over the next several quarters. You have exceptional growth in terms of the percent of operating income in the first quarter, how much can you continue to squeeze out of costs, technology costs, et cetera. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: Your first question related to the war, we saw softness in the last weeks in the first quarter and we saw that recover quite nicely in the first few weeks of April and that reflected in the Q2 guidance. As it relates to productivity, you know, it's difficult to talk to absolute numbers going forward. I think the way you should look at it is this. We are spending a lot of time internally on it. We are focused our concepts in two ways. One is how do we make sure we get great internal productivities, doing things more efficiently every day, the second is how do we get better prices or what we call "deflation" with our suppliers. Looking at it in a details level across the business and trying to drive prices down for all the goods and services we buy. 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: I will say that we are already very, very focused on this before Tom arrived here and since Tom got here, we've been able to reaccelerate that effort. I think it's going very, very well. 

 SHAWN MILNE: Great, thank you very much. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Operator, can we take the next question, please? 

 OPERATOR: Next question from Mary Meeker from Morgan Stanley. 

 MARY MEEKER, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Great quarter up 35% year over year. [INAUDIBLE ] could you quantify for us [ INAUDIBLE ]? 

 TIM HALLADAY: Mary, before you hang up, I want to make sure we got your questions, it was tough to hear you. The essential question was we had 35% unit growth for three quarters in a row? The second question was quantifying something that was leveraging, a question that we couldn't hear you. 

 MARY MEEKER: The question was could you help us quantify what the benefit might be for better terms one year out. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Terms? 

 MARY MEEKER: Better terms with suppliers. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Got it. Thank you. 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: We're very positive about our opportunity for growth, and obviously we had great unit growth in the first quarter. That made up of as we mentioned North American was up 28%, international up 52%, we are very positive about our business as it related to growth. The second part, it's probably hard to quantify, yeah. A year out exactly how much progress we'll make. It has a lot to do with how quickly, there's a lot of operational issues involved. As you get to the volume required to make sense to do a portion of your volume directly with manufacturers and publishers as opposed to going through distribution, we're at the volume levels where more and more of that makes sense. We are doing some of it. But it's not something that comes in and kind of step functions, it comes in a little bit at a time. It will be continuous, I guess that's where I would leave it. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: Thanks, Mary. 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: On the growth rates I would add that the things we are doing to drive growth are the right things. So because of that, we are very optimistic. We'll have to wait and see what happens. Customers are responding to the relentless focus of adding selection, continuing lower prices and will be more price reductions this year. We will continue to do that. So increasing selection, reducing prices, increasing reliability, speed of fulfillment, making products easier to find, making the website easier to use, you'll see improvement in every single one of those buckets this year and that is what drives unit growth. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks, Mary. Operator, next question please. 

 OPERATOR: The next question is from Heath Terry of CSFB. 

 HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CSFB: Looking at the shipping loss of $7 million in the quarter, looks like that was around 2.5% of revenue. How much leverage do you have there to bring that down further? Can we assume that's going to be a relatively stable percentage going forward? 

 TOM SZKUTAK: I think you should look at it is actually the adoption rate of super saver shipping as we've had different offers over the past 18 months, we've had more and more customers are adopting that. We've seen as we look at the last five quarters, every single quarter of that has increased in terms of number of customers liking it. It's difficult for us to predict actually going forward, whether that trend will continue. Obviously we be leaving the super saver shipping offer in place year round. It's difficult for us to estimate that but it's going well and customers like it. 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: It's not going away any time soon, in fact, it's not going away ever. We like it, the customers like it. Its 365 days a year. Please take advantage of it soon. 

 HEATH TERRY: Thank you. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Operator, next question, please. 

 OPERATOR: Next question comes from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Banc Securities. 

 JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANC: A couple of questions, based on the free shipping initiative, you're getting to the point where kind of a number of units you are getting per active customer getting to the point where you are starting to get more frequency. At the same time if you look at contribution for customers, that's turning around as well. Are you starting to see the ROI feedback from free shipping innative from a dollar standpoint and happening at profit line, can you elaborate whether that is happening or not? Second question was as you look at new categories and new markets over the next couple of years, can you give us a sense what the Cap Ex looks like and what is required to get into a new category dollar wise, time wise and a new market, something we could try to model going forward as you launch new markets and categories. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: Right. On super saver shipping, the way I would look at it is this, no question about a change of behavior. Customers like it. The units going out as a percentage of total is increasing in terms of adoption rates. Certainly in first quarter as well as in 2003, you should assume that it's a cost to us. You will not see a full return from that investment in 2003, that's the way we're looking at it. We do expect that over time, we'll get a significant return from investment. The cost in both first quarter and the total year. 

 As far as Cap Ex, the way we are looking at it from a reinvestment ratio, Cap Ex as a percentage of depreciation that will be, our Cap Ex will be less than one when you look at that ratio. In 2004 Jeff challenged the team to do that again. Beyond that it's difficult to forecast. Certainly you won't see the large spikes that you've seen historically just because of the way we've invested in technology and discussions. 

 JEETIL PATEL: Can you talk about what expenses or costs are required to launch a new category? 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: I was going to add that launching a new category is very, very capital inexpensive for us. That is not one of the constraints. The main thing that constrains new category launches is more -- the people bandwidth of organizing the category, building the supply chain for that category, any software developments that has to be done for that and so on. It tends not to be -- these are not heavy lifting capital exercises to get a new category launched, quite the opposite. In fact, we've said before that in terms of even fulfillment centers, that's pretty capital efficient, too. We built our original fulfillment centers on the order of $50 million each and that is, we know a lot more now than we did then on how to do that and we can do that for significantly less. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks Jeetil. Operator, can we take the next question, please. 

 OPERATOR: Next question comes from Jeff Fieler with Bear Stearns. 

 JEFF FIELER, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: One of the big changes from this quarter [INAUDIBLE] 20% year over year in Q4, can you give us a breakdown where that is coming from? And also on the from the cash flow line, trailing 12 month free cash flow looks like it's down from Q4 levels and curious what we should read into that. Is that a function of lower account payable days and are the lower account payable days part of discounts for early payments you were talking about, Tom? 

 TOM SZKUTAK: Sure. The first part of that with electronics general merchandise, there's no question we've seen accelerated growth in that segment and both in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S. it's 32% growth year over year. Globally up 37% year over year. We are pleased with the segment. We look at it at a much more detailed level and a skew level as we look at our growth. Again I think that's difficult to communicate to you on this call. 

 In terms of free cash flow. Certainly seasonality in our cash flow. You shouldn't read anything into that. Certainly our payable is down from a year ago. At 44 days versus 45. What we did see with some of the slowdown in the last two weeks of the quarter, that certainly impacted our operating cycle just temporarily for those few weeks. We've seen our orders come back in the first few weeks so it's not, we're not looking at it as a significant trend or anything like that and obviously focused on growing free cash flow over the course of the year and next year. 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: I would only add that if you look at our electronics business, the thing from a customer experience point of view driving that acceleration is compared to a year ago, significantly lower prices as well as very good relative to a year ago instock availability. Those are the two big customer experience changes year over year driving that business. 

 JEFF FIELER: Driving through profitability? 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: Yes, the increased contribution profits in that business need to be aggregated across more units. The key thing in that business is unit growth. 

 JEFF FIELER: Thanks, very much. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Operator, can we make this our last question, please? 

 OPERATOR: Yes, sir. The final question comes from Steve Weinstein of Pacific Crest. 

 STEVE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST: Thank you. Follow-up to the last question. In regard to your general merchandise business, you've got things where you want them now in the type of growth we are seeing, you can extrapolate that going forward? That is one. And, two, looking from a currency neutral basis, significant acceleration on a year over year basis. My guess is we'll start to see that rate slow, the rate of acceleration slow. Can you give us a more detailed outlook? 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: I'll take the first piece of that and then Tom can take the last piece. Electronics and general merchandise business, huge year over year progress and that, our electronics store, for example now does have good availability on what is about ten times the selection you would find in a big box electronic super store. People really are more and more finding what they are looking for and finding when they do price comparisons that we have the lowest price. So price and availability very, very good. Still a tremendous amount of room. Still a lot of selection that can be improved in that business. And we'll keep working on that. 

 Whether you can anticipate that these growth rates will continue forward or not, I wouldn't want to speak to that specifically, we consciously don't give guidance on that level of detail. But that's certainly, we're going to be working hard to make the customer experience better and if the past is a guide to the future, every time we improve the customer experience along one of those critical available, we see unit growth rates increase. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: As far as the international segment, unit growth was up 52% year over year, revenue growth was up 68% year over year. And you're right, we did have favorable impact of exchange to bring that down to 45% year over year. The only thing I would say on that is certainly the last two weeks of the quarter was softer, you know globally for us and including the international segment, that has come back well in the first few weeks of April. Again no question there was some effect but difficult to quantify how much. 

 STEVE WEINSTEIN: Thank you. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks, Steve. With that I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. As a reminder a replay is available on our Investor Relations website through the end of the quarter. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter and thanks for your interest in Amazon.com. 

 JEFFREY BEZOS: Thank you. 

 OPERATOR: Thank you for participating in today's Amazon.com 2003 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.

 OPERATOR: Good afternoon. My name is Tiffany and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amazon.com Q4 2002 financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star then the number 1 on your telephone key pad. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tim Halladay, V.P. Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Halladay. You may begin your conference, sir. 

 TIM HALLADAY, VICE PRESIDENT, INVESTOR RELATIONS, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Good afternoon. Welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2002 conference call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Bezos, our CEO, and Tom Szkutak, our chief financial officer. 

   TD
 Please keep in mind that the following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management views as of today, January 23rd, 2003 only, and will include forward-look statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Additional information about factors that could potentially affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in today's press release and the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its annual report on form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2001 and all subsequent filings. 

 As you listen to today's call, I would encourage you to have our press release in front of you, since all of our financial results, as well as commentary on the quarter are included and will correspond to much of the discussion that follows. You will also find a table which reconciles our GAAP results to pro forma results. Pro forma results are included for the benefit of investors, as they have been and continue to be a useful analytical companion to our GAAP results. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons used in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2001. 

 With that introduction, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. 

 JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. 

 Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to thank the people that made this Q4 our best ever, starting with our customers around the world who ordered in record numbers. We're extremely grateful. And the big team of people here at Amazon.com who served those customers did a fantastic job. They delivered a record number of units. In stock availability was at record highs, and contacts per order, are most sensitive measure of customer satisfaction, was at record levels. 

 This year was our eighth holiday. And in terms of customer experience, it was clearly our best ever. We've already started working hard to ensure that our ninth holiday is even better yet. 

 A year ago, we outlined our 2002 objectives. First, to add selection by making our platform available to additional sellers. Second, to significantly lower prices for customers. Third, to drive our international business towards profitability. And fourth, to generate positive operating cash flow. 

 I'm pleased to say that the results we report today reflect our success in achieving each of these objectives. A year ago, we had over 100,000 third parties selling on our web site. Today, that number is over half a million, including sellers in the U.K., Germany and Japan. 

 During the fourth quarter, we we launched our Apparel and Accessories store, with over 450 brands that you can purchase in a single shopping cart. Based on the number of units sold in the first 60 days, this is our most successful store launch ever. We've always believed customers would accept a wide range of offerings from us, and the successful launch of apparel is good evidence of that. This is important because it speaks to the size of our ultimate addressable market. 

 A few specific data points: we sold 153,000 shirts, from Polo Ralph Lauren button downs to DKNY blouses; 78,000 jackets, from Old Navy fleece to Polar Tech Windbreakers; 106,000 pairs of pants, from Gap khakis to Guess jeans; 77,000 pairs of shoes, from Nike Air Max to Nine West boots; 46,000 accessories, including handbags, watches, scarfs and so on; and 31,000 pairs of underwear, from Jockey briefs to Hugo Boss boxers. In fact, since we opened the Apparel store, we hoped we might be able to answer the age-old question: boxers or briefs? Unfortunately, the answer remains illusive. The ratio is approximately 1.15 to 1 in favor of briefs, but the results are not yet statistically significant. Please place your own vote with a purchase. 

 Significantly lower prices also drove results this quarter. In the last 18 months, we lowered prices five times, and it's working. We could afford the pricing actions because of our significant improvements in operating efficiency. We saw an acceleration in our revenue growth rate from 13% in 2001 to 26% in 2002, an improvement of $225 million year-over-year in pro forma operating profit and an over $300 million improvement in free cash flow. 

 I'm especially pleased with the impact that lower prices had on our BMV and ETK businesses. We began executing the strategy over 18 months ago, and you can see it in our results as BMV revenue growth rates rebounded from a 1% decline in 2001 to an increase of 11% in 2002, with ETK revenue growth also improving nearly 5 points year over year to 18%. Unit growth in both segments is even faster. 

 We told you that in the new year, we would make a decision on the right threshold for our Super Saver Shipping offer. I'm pleased to tell you that effective today, we've decided to offer everyday, year-round Free Super Saver Shipping and leave the threshold in place at the $25 level. We're also introducing, effective today, Free Super Saver Delivery for orders over 39 pounds at Amazon.co.uk. This represents a significant reduction in total price for our customers across all of our product lines. Even though Super Saver Shipping is expensive for Amazon.com, it is the right investment to make and is in the long-term best interest of our shareholders and our customers. 

 Let me be clear. At this point, when you shop at Amazon.com instead of in the physical world, you are saving a lot of money. Our product prices have always been low ,and now with Free Super Saver Shipping, our end price is even lower. 

 To illustrate this point, we decided to compare our prices to book prices in the physical world, where nine out of ten books are still sold. That's where all of the volume is. For this past weekend, we did a price comparison versus a major well-known chain of book superstores to see how much people could save by shopping at Amazon.com. 

 Specifically, here's what we did. To make the exercise objective, we began with this superstore chain's own published list of its 100 best sellers for 2002. It wasn't a hand-picked list that we created. It was their list, and it featured 45 hard cover titles, 55 paperback titles, ranging across many categories including literature, romance, mystery, nonfiction, children's, self-help and so on. It was a good representation of the kinds of books people buy the most. Then we priced all 100 titles by visiting their superstores in both Seattle and New York City. It took us six hours to find all 100 titles, and we had to go to four different stores to find them. 

 What did we find? First, 99 of the 100 books on their list were available at Amazon.com, ready to ship within 24 hours. Second, at this particular superstore chain, this list of their 100 best selling books for 2002 cost a total of $1,561. At Amazon.com, the same 100 books cost $1,195, for a total savings of $366. In other words, our customers pay 23% less for these 2002 best sellers. For paperbacks on the list, Amazon.com customers saved an average of 17% and for hard customers -- I'm sorry, for hard covers, our customers saved an average of 27%. For 72 of the 100 books, our price was cheaper. On 25 of the books, our price was the same. And on the three titles where their prices were better, our books team has already reduced our prices. In this particular chain's physical world superstores, only 15 of their 100 titles were discounted. They were selling the other 85 at full list price. At Amazon.com, 76 of the 100 were discounted, and 24 were sold at list price. 

 Let me reiterate that this was not a specially contrived list to showcase savings. You'll see similar results for virtually any list you create because Amazon.com's strategy is not to discount a small number of best sellers for a short time, but instead to offer low prices every day that apply broadly across our entire product range. And by the way, the comparisons we just discussed were for our prices on new books. Of course, you would save even more if you used our web site to purchase used books. There may still be reasons to shop in the physical world; for instance, if you need something right now, but you will be paying a premium. We're pleased to report that the word is getting out, and customers are beginning to realize that they're saving money by shopping at Amazon.com. 

 Moving to the final two objectives, our international segment is now almost a $1.2 billion business and grew 77% in 2002. At the same time, we made quicker than anticipated progress towards profitability, as our international segment pro forma operating profit improved $31 million year-over-year to $20 million in Q4. We had similar success in our objective of generating positive operating cash flow for the year. We achieved that; but in addition, we were also able to generate positive free cash flow for the year of $135 million. I'll remind you this number includes $110 million of cash interest expense and $40 million of capital expenditures and excludes proceeds from stock option exercises. 

 Let me conclude with the following point. Our long-term goal remains the same: To generate substantial growing free cash flow on a sustained basis. Our strategy to accomplish that is an obsessive focus on customers, including expanding selection, lowering prices, and doing a great job for our partners. It is that relentless focus on the customer experience that's gotten us this far. and it will take us the rest of the way, too. 

 With that, let me turn it over to Tom. 

 TOM SZKUTAK, CFO, AMAZON.COM, INC.: Thanks, Jeff ,and hello, everyone. It is great to be with you here today. 

 This was a great quarter for me to start here at Amazon.com. First, fueled by lower prices, our positive business trends continued. Revenues reached a record $1.429 billion, representing growth of 28% over the prior year, our fourth consecutive quarter of greater than 20% growth. Adjusting for the favorable impact from foreign exchange rate, overall revenue growth of the quarter was 25%. 

 Full year revenues were $3.93 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Pro forma operating profit was also a record $102 million, or 7.1% of sales, including a $3 million benefit from foreign exchange rates. For 2002, pro forma operating profit reached $180 million, an improvement of $225 million over 2001. Pro forma net income, which includes interest expense, was $75 million or 19 cents per share. Active customer accounts with purchases in the last 12 months totaled 31 million, a 26% year-over-year increase. 

 Unit growth for the year was 34%, continued to outpace revenue growth and provide meaningful benefit to a bottom line result. Third party units as a percentage of North American units served was 30% for the quarter, an increase from 22% one year ago. Worldwide, third party units reached 21% of all units served. Free cash flow for 2002 was $135 million, a year-over-year improvement in excess of $300 million. The combination of common stock outstanding and employee stock base awards decreased 1% year-over-year. 

 Second, our international business continued to exceed our expectations. International segment revenue grew 76% this quarter, with revenue growth exceeding 60% in each of our four international web sites. It is now approaching a $1.2 billion business on a trailing 12 month basis. After reaching break-even last quarter, the international segment was profitable in Q4, with pro forma operating profit of $20 million or over 4% of revenue for the year. The segment approached break even with a loss of approximately $600,000 for the year. Japan, after only two years, is now our fastest subsidiary to reach essentially break-even, with a pro forma operating margin of under 1% for the quarter. 

 Third, our financial progress allows us to continue to invest. We will make $25 Free Super Saver Shipping a year round offer in the U.S. and introduce Free Super Saver Delivery in the U.K. We'll open and promote a number of new stores in 2003, and we'll continue to find ways to offer the best value proposition for our customers through lower prices and selection and unparalleled [indiscernible]. 

 Free shipping and lower prices are expensive and will negatively impact profits and cash flow in the near term. In fact, in 2003, we expected our customers will save in excess of $100 million through our free shipping offers. We believe that this is the right investment and will benefit our shareholders over the long-term. 

 Now, moving to the operating expense portion. Pro forma expense was 8.9% of sales, down over 90 basis points from 9.8% a year ago. In absolute dollars, pro forma expense increased 16 % to $125 million on a sales increase of 28% [indiscernible]. 

 Our improvement was driven by the following: First, unit growth. As we've mentioned many times in the past, our fixed costs will not grow at the same pace as [indiscernible], which results in lower fixed cost per unit. Second, efficiency. Our continued focus on cost improvement and inventory accuracy resulted in significant benefits to customer experience in our financial results. Reliability for holiday orders and worldwide inventory accuracy reached record levels. In stock availability for our top selling items on the U.S. site was a record high of 98%. [Indiscernible], or the amount of time taken by our fulfillment center to process an order improved 17%. In our most sensitive measure of customer satisfaction, contacts per order, we saw a 13% improvement. 

 We made all of this progress while still meeting holiday deadlines. We kept free shipping in place eight days longer than 2001 and standard shipping in place for an additional four days. I would like to remind you that as you forecast our fulfillment costs going forward, that this amount includes credit card interchange fees. On sales third party product, the credit card fee is calculated on the gross sale, not our net revenue share. Therefore, you should expect credit card fees as a percentage of absolute fulfillment costs to increase over time with the success of our third party sellers. 

 Pro forma operating profit was $102 million versus $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, an improvement of more than $43 million or 74%. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of operating profit as our operating margin improved 187 basis points year-over-year to 7.1%. 

 Stepping back and looking at the quarter, the operating dynamics that we saw are similar to what we would expect to see over the next few years. We will continue to have growth driven by new categories, international expansion, third party sellers, lower prices and free shipping. Beyond the customer benefit of all of these are technology and fixed infrastructure will also be leveraged. We'll continue to drive further productivity internally and lower cost of what we call deflation with our external suppliers. We believe that our growth and cost initiatives we have in place will lead to sustainable growth and free cash flow. 

 Fourth quarter pro forma net income was $75 million and 19 cents per share compared to 9 cents per share one year ago. For total 2002, our pro forma net income was $66 million or 17 cents per share compared to a loss of $157 million and 43 cents per share in 2001. On a GAAP basis, our net income was $3 million or one cent per share compared to net income of $5 million also 1 cent per share in the prior year. 

 For the quarter, there are four key differences year-over-year in the GAAP results. First, we incurred a stock based competition charge of $36 million in Q4 2002, primarily due to a $31 million charge for the upward movement in our stock price compared to a $2 million charge in 2001. Second, we had a $38 million charge in the current quarter for year base debt compared to a $17 million benefit in the prior year. Third, we had a $5 million restructuring benefit in the fourth quarter 2002, as we terminated the lease for a vacated fulfillment center in Georgia compared to a $5 million charge in the prior year. And fourth, amortization of goodwill, and other intangibles were $1 million in Q4 2002 compared to $38 million in 2001. 

 On a net basis, these four items negatively impacted current quarter GAAP results by $7 million compared to a $27 million charge in the prior year. Although we report the GAAP net income of $3 million, we believe that this positive net income result is not predictive of future results or trends and should not be viewed as material positive event. Our primary focus is on the inputs that drive pro forma operating results in the generation of free cash flow. Free cash flow reached $135 million in 2002, an improvement of over $300 million year-over-year. 

 When thinking about operating free cash flow for 2003 and beyond, let me remind you that predicting the elements of working capital at this point in time can be volatile and subject to many variables including seasonality, the timing of accrued expenses and the discounts offered by vendors. You should expect that we may take advantage of offers from vendors when it is the right economic trade, but over time, fluctuations of working capital will even out and a trend line will develop. It is our intent for free cash flow to be up into the right of the long-term. 

 Let me move to asset efficiency. Inventory was $202 million at December 31, 2002, up from $144 million a year ago. While balancing the benefits of in stock availability with inventory terms of working capital, we took advantage of various buying opportunities from our vendors at year end. Of note, our electronics inventory worldwide represented $32 million or approximately 16% of the total. And in fourth quarter, we turned our U.S. electronics inventory [indiscernible]: Inventory turns were 19 on a current 12-month basis, an improvement of 22% year-over-year. I encourage you to compare this metric to other world-class retailers. Our net investment of fixed assets which was $239 million decreased 12% from a year ago. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $1.3 billion, more than $300 million above a year ago. 

 I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance for Q1 and an update for our base plan expectations for 2003. Incorporated into our Q1 guidance in 2003 expectations are the order trends we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, we also recognize there's a high level of uncertainty surrounding the global economy, consumer spending, and the impact of both on world events. While we are cautiously optimistic about the coming year, it is it not possible to accurately predict and therefore our actual results could differ from our guidance. Also, when we think about growth, we're only concerned with one thing, long-term growth and free cash flow. 

 For the march quarter, we expect net sales between $1.025 billion and $1.075 billion. As you would expect, this guidance assumes currency, foreign currency rates stay approximately where they are today. We cannot predict fluctuations with foreign currency rates going forward. We expect our pro forma net income to be between $5 million and $20 million, a pro forma earnings share of a penny to 5 cents per share. When comparing this with a year ago, please remember that this guidance incorporates $25 free super saver shipping for the entire quarter versus $99 for a portion of the prior year quarter. 

 For calendar 2003, our baseline expectations are: net sales to grow by over 15% and we expect pro forma net income to be over $115 million or over 27 cents per share. Let me remind everyone since certain stock options are currently subject to variable accounting, we incur enough non-cash charges [indiscernible]. Also, we mark our year to [indiscernible]. The result will be a noncash gain or loss. Therefore, we cannot forecast either of these items yet they could have significant impact either positively or negatively on the GAAP result. 

 Before opening up the questions, let me close with a final few thoughts. First and foremost, I want to thank our customers for visiting us over the holidays and taking advantage of our selection, convenience and pricing. We strive to always put the customer first. We believe that approach drives the market. Second, while we are cautiously optimistic, we're pleased to increase our guidance. Third, our model is validating itself as we reap the benefits of scale. While we continue to invest in low prices in unit growth, we'll work hard both internally to increase productivity and externally with our suppliers. Ultimately, we'll measure our success toward our objective of generating significant free cash flow. Finally, all of us at Amazon.com have the same objective. We're collectively driven to deliver for both our customers and our shareholders. 

 Tim, let's move to questions. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks, Jeff and Tom. With that, we would like to move on to the Q & A portion of the call. In the interest of allowing as many people as possible to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, if you could remind our listeners how to ask a question, we'll proceed with the call. 

 OPERATOR: Certainly. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then the number 1 on your telephone key pad. If you are using a speakerphone, please remember to pick up the handset before asking your question. And our first question comes from Anthony Noto. 

 ANTHONY NOTO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much. Hi, everyone. First, Jeff, I guess in the interest of all of those out there that are wearing boxers, please put me down for boxers as opposed to briefs. Secondly, as we think about the $25 free shipping, what sort of data points or research can you share with us that indicates that this offer is driving either incremental penetration of new users that you would not have otherwise gotten or incremental purchases from current users that may not have purchased again? And just give us some understanding of those benefits that we should benefit from long-term. They're actually seeing today to support that decision and then secondly, there is a lot of debates surrounding your operating margins and while they were strong in this quarter, as we think out over the next couple of years, you have a long-term goal of double digit operating margins. Where do you think they could be by say 2005 to give us a little bit closer end road map? Thanks. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: To answer your first question, on -- this is Tom, on super saver shipping, we've obviously looked at it a number of different ways. And we're certainly comfortable that we're getting a lift from super saver shipping and we can tell you that our customers like it. In terms of sharing the absolute data, we don't think -- we think it's competitive information and not right to share it with you at this time. So, suffice it to say though, that it is certainly a long-term investment for our business. Our customers saved over $30 million in fourth quarter. They'll save over $100 million in 2003. It is definitely the right thing for our customers and our shareholders during the long-term. In terms of the other question surrounding operating margins, you know, we're giving guidance for 2003. We're not giving guidance for beyond that. But you know, our goal obviously is to improve margins over time. We think we have the right growth formula and the right operating formula to do that. 

 JEFF BEZOS: The only thing I was getting at is that -- we haven't changed our goals -- our long-term goals with respect to operating margins but the caveat we always give with that is that we're ultimately going to do the right thing with respect to maximizing you know, dollar operating profit rather than percentage operating margins. And so you know, if -- ultimately, if there is a conflict between those two things, it will be an easy decision for us to make. 

 ANTHONY NOTO: Ok. Thank you very much. 

 JEFF BEZOS: Thank you, Anthony. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Operator, next question, please. 

 OPERATOR: Our next question is from Heath Terry of Credit Suisse First Boston. 

 HEATH TERRY, ANALYST, CSFB: Great, thanks a lot. Can you talk a little bit about the ETK segment? Earlier, had you talked about the outside possibility of getting that segment to profitability by the end of this year. Do you still think that's -- is that still something that you're looking for? And then if you could also just talk a little bit about the cash flow metrics you're going to be looking at this year. What should we expect for Cap Ex and what do you think the relationship between operating the operating cash flow number you're looking for being positive this year in free cash flow will look like. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: n terms of your first question on ETK, we're very pleased with our progress in ETK. We grew 21% year-over-year and we're going to continue to drive scale in that business. With scale, we think the margins will come. We'll have a lot more leverage once we're able to do that. In terms of cash, we're obviously -- it is a very important measure to us. We're not giving guidance for cash in 2003. But in terms of Cap Ex, I think for your purposes, you can assume that consistent with the last two years, our Cap Ex will be below depreciation and amortization. But again, in the long run, from a cash perspective, we expect to be -- it will be a primary focus and we're going to sustain long-term cash flow over time. 

 HEATH TERRY: Is it the goal of ETK profitable by the end of this year? 

 TIM HALLADAY: Operator, next question, please. 

 OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Safa Rashtchy of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 

 SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, U.S. BANCORP PIPER JAFFRAY: Good afternoon. Congratulations and a good quarter. On the -- international operations, Jeff or Tom, you alluded that Japan is nearly profitable. Do you have a goal for international profitability in 2003? Do you think you can achieve that? And also separately, on the Apparel store which you said has been the most successful launch of any store yet, can you talk about the potential impact of customers who are coming for apparel, who perhaps were not Amazon customers at all. Can you share any data, maybe if not at the future point with us as to what percentage of customers haven't shopped at Amazon before and how do you see the impact of that traffic? Thank you. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of your first question, regarding international, we're obviously not giving segment guidance on this call. We're pleased -- we're very pleased with the results that our international segment had in 2002. We're expecting great results from our international team again in 2003. But again, we're not giving any specific guidance today. In terms of apparel, you know, we're -- as we had mentioned, earlier, we're extremely pleased with the results to date. It was our most successful launch in the first 60 days that we've had in terms of traffic that that's generated you know, we're not in a position really to disclose that at this time. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks. Operator, can we take the next question, please? 

 OPERATOR: Our next question is from Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley. 

 MARY MEEKER, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks. Couple of clarification questions. I think you've typically given out active customers. If you could give us the stat for the fourth quarter there, that would be great. You indicated in your press release that unit growth was 34% year to year for 2002. By our math, that implies that unit growth in the fourth quarter was about 35%. That reasonable? And final question, it certainly appears that you indicated that the apparel launch was successful in the fourth quarter. It appears you're getting good feedback from your apparel partners. Do you think it's conceivable in 2003 that we'll see some of those major apparel partners begin to ramp co-marketing efforts from their end with Amazon.com? Thanks. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: Just to answer your first question on active customer accounts. The active customer account were purchased in the last 12 months were 31 million which is the 26% growth over prior year. 

 MARY MEEKER: Thanks, Tom. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: In terms of units growth, you asked a question about units growth for the fourth quarter. We disclosed total year was up 34%. I think you could assume that, you know, fourth quarter was higher than total year, nominally higher. That's a fair assumption. And then your last question on apparel. 

 JEFF BEZOS: On the apparel, there has already been a small amount of co-marketing. 

 MARY MEEKER: Yep. 

 JEFF BEZOS: And you know, I would expect that to grow over time. How rapidly that will grow, I think we'll have to wait and see. But I think if done correctly, it is in the interest of both parties. 

 MARY MEEKER: Thank you. 

 OPERATOR: Our next question is from Lanny Baker of Salomon Smith Barney. 

 LANNY BAKER, ANALYST, SALOMON SMITH BARNEY: Questions about capital structure, I guess. When do you think the company would potentially need to invest more money in another distribution center? You shut down the lease on one in this quarter but is there a time frame out there where you think you're going to have to put capital in that direction? And then sort of an alternative capital allocation question, is there -- as you start to accumulate now free cash, how do you -- how are you going to prioritize the right-hand side of the balance sheet, taking down the debt versus buying back stock? 

 TOM SZKUTAK: To answer your first question on fulfillment centers, we have no plans to add any additional capacity fulfillment in 2003. Jeff has challenged our team to also do the same thing -- to do the same thing in 2004. I think that remains to be seen at this point. In terms of your last question, on cash and capital structure, you know, it's something that -- thanks for the question. 

 LANNY BAKER: Brand new. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: Up until about a year, 18 months ago, we were getting a lot of other questions about how we were going to repay our debt in 2008, 2009, 2010 but we have time to make the decisions. We'll make those very carefully and keep our investors in mind. But I think at this point talking about how we would do that is probably not appropriate. 

 LANNY BAKER: Thanks. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks, Lanny. Operator, can we take the next question. 

 OPERATOR: Our next question is from Sean Milne from SoundView Tech Group. 

 SEAN MILNE, ANALYST, SOUNDVIEW TECH GROUP: Thank you very much. Tom, just a real quick question on gross margins in the quarter. Obviously impacted by the free shipping. But if you look into the segment breakdown, can you just walk us through the services gross margin? Was that an impact from coupon and you know, the uptake in ETK on a sequential basis. I assume that's a swing around from the wireless. That would be great. Thanks. 

 TOM SZKUTAK: Let me start with gross margins from a total business perspective, first. There are a couple of things that you see that are going on with the gross margins. First, our international segment is obviously growing at a much faster rate than the core. Our international segment, as you know, has a lower gross margin than the core part of our business so that's one. In terms of the services segments, specifically, we're actually just to make a comment on our total services business, we're actually very, very pleased with our total service business. We've added some great partners and many of these service type revenues actually appear in the other segments such as ETK, so, when you think of J and R Electronics, Circuit City, the services are included in the ETK segment. So, just wanted to give you a full picture on services. As at the relates to the services segment when you see the margins going down, that really relates back to some major, older advertising marketing agreements that we had back in 1999 and 2000 that we've talked about in the past that are running off and you know, for the next several quarters, you know, will be available us to. But as you look at the total services business, which includes services in the individual segments, we actually look pretty good. 

 SEAN MILNE: Thank you. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks, Sean. Operator, can we take the next question, please. 

 OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jeff Fieler of Bear, Stearns. 

 JEFF FIELER, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Good afternoon. Wanted to ask a question on the -- how are you thinking about marketing these days in terms of your actual marketing spend, it was down about $10 million on a year over year basis and wondered if that was an area you were going to prioritize and perhaps grow again in 2003 or if you're looking at it in a broader sense and seeing the losses that you're taking on the shipping side as a form of -- as a form of marketing in putting the two things together as a better way of looking at that. 

 JEFF BEZOS: That is pretty much how we look at it. We look at all of our different types of marketing and broad scale marketing, on-line marketing. There are a bunch of different things we do. And then we have things like free super saver shipping on orders over $25. Lower product prices. If we can make it make sense for the business, that's actually the best form of marketing because we're giving the money directly to our customers. And we prefer to do that whenever possible and so we do look at those two and kind of -- more traditional marketing. We weigh that against things like free super saver shipping. 

 JEFF FIELER: So what do you anticipate doing? 

 JEFF BEZOS: Go ahead, Jeff. 

 JEFF FIELER: Just a follow-up in terms of the core marketing side and where you were with the trials on the TV commercials. 

 JEFF BEZOS: We will -- we'll continue to evaluate our broad scale marketing as we go forward over time and see what we want to do. You know, there are no big revelations to make at this point. 

 JEFF FIELER: Great. Thanks very much. 

 JEFF BEZOS: You're welcome. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Operator, can we make this our last question, please. 

 OPERATOR: Certainly. Our last question comes from Jeetil Patel of Deutsch Banc Securities. 

 JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANC SECURITIES: Thanks, hey, guys. Couple of questions. First of all, yeah, you mentioned -- you talked about international expansion and category kind of new categories coming on. Can you talk about international expansion. Would you --do you think that the opportunity lies in Europe or Asia Pacific as you look at it over the next two years? And then secondly, as you look at product category expansion, how extensionible is the Rainier's merchandising and marketing platform from a back end standpoint to go into new categories over the course of this year? And then secondly, eCommerce growth seems to be coming around 20% again for this year. Can you talk about I guess the categories within eCommerce that seem to be growing faster that may be attractive as you look over the course of this year. And the out year as well. 

 JEFF BEZOS: Well, on international expansion, we will, over time, enter additional countries. What kind of schedule we'll do that, whether or not there will be any of that this year, we'll have to wait and see. The countries we're in today represent such a large fraction of eCommerce penetration that we think it makes sense for us and our shareholders to focus on those countries, make sure we're doing a great job there. So, that's one thing. We will open a number of new categories, new stores this year. And in answer to your question, the software that we've developed is quite flexible. And does allow us to do that. In a sort of low cost attractive way. And so under expect us -- you should expect to see that. And then -- Was there one more? Was that it? 

 JEETIL PATEL: If you look at the growth rates of eCommerce, are there categories that seem to be attractive from a growth rate standpoint. 

 JEFF BEZOS: Well, I think apparel is one of those categories, seems to be growing very quickly and so we're glad that we're in that category and with, I think, an outstanding offering, the team that did that did just a fine piece of work. We're continuing to add selection and new brands there. So, that's when we're very happy to be in. As far as future categories, to -- to tip our hand as to where we might be headed next. 

 Thanks, Jeetil. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. A replay of this call will be available on our investor relations web site through the end of the quarter. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter and thanks for your interest in Amazon.com. 

 JEFF BEZOS: Thank you. 

 OPERATOR: Thank you again for participating in this afternoon's conference. You may now disconnect.

 OPERATOR, : Good afternoon. My name is Matthew and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Amazon.com Q3 2002 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer period. If you would like to ask a question during this time simply press star and the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question press star and the number two on your telephone keypad. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Halladay, VP Investor Relations. Mr. Halladay you may begin your conference. 

   TD
 TIM HALLADAY, VP INVESTOR RELATIONS , AMAZON.COM: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Amazon.com third quarter 2002 conference call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Bezos our CEO and Mark Peek our VP and Chief Accounting Officer. Please keep in mind that the following discussion and responses to your questions are management's view as of today October 24, 2002 only and will include forward looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially than those projected. Additional information about factors that could potentially affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in today's press release and the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its annual report on form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2001 and all subsequent filings. As you listen to today's call I would encourage you to have our press release in front of you since all of our financial results as well as commentary on the quarter are included, and will correspond to much of the discussion that follows. You'll also find a table which reconciles our GAAP results pro forma results -- pro forma results are included for the benefit of investors as they have been and continue to be a useful analytical companion for our GAAP results. Unless otherwise stated all comparisons used in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2001. With that introduction I will turn the call over to Jeff. 

 JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, AMAZON.COM: Thanks Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Before I begin I want to take a moment to welcome Tom Szkutak our new CFO to Amazon.com. Tom comes to us with 20 years experience in various divisions of GE. Most recently as the CFO of GE Lighting. Tom's been on board since the first of the month and it's great to have him helping us. He'll be formally involved in the call next quarter, and I want to thank Mark for sharing the detailed results with you again this quarter. 

 The excellent results that we report today are the outcome of investments we started making years ago. Investments in category expansion, investments in international expansion, investments in marketplace, investments in operating efficiency and lower prices for customers. I am especially pleased with the impact that our strategy of lowering prices has had on the growth of our business. We began executing this strategy over 15 months ago, and you can see it in our results, as revenues increased 33% over the prior year, and unit growth was at its highest level in two years. 

 All of this growth was achieved organically. Our books, music and video revenue growth rate accelerated to 17%, fueled by the many price reductions we've introduced over the past five quarters. Unit growth in this segment was even higher. Electronics, tools and kitchen had revenue growth of 25% YoverY with unit growth of 39%, as our prices continue to get sharper and our selection continues to expand. Our electronics selection is now more than ten times the selection than a typical big box electronics store. For example, we have over 250 different digital cameras, over 200 different DVD players and over 220 different LCD monitors. All of which are available for purchase today. 

 Our international business continues to grow rapidly. For each of the last four quarters our international segment has experienced revenue growth in excess of 70%, including over 90% growth in the current quarter. This year our international business will surpass $1b dollars, and including exports, represented 36% of overall revenues this quarter. 

 Even with substantial investments in lower prices for customers, we continue to make significant progress on the bottom line. Pro forma net income was basically break even for the quarter, up from a loss of $58m a year ago. And on trailing 12-month basis, we have pro forma net income for the first time of $26m. Most important is the improvement we have seen in our trailing 12-month free cash flow, reaching $120m -- an increase of over $400m YoverY. I'll remind you that this number includes $110m of cash interest expense and $30m of capital expenditures, and excludes proceeds from stock option exercises. 

 The foundation of these results has been and continues to be our relentless focus on the end-to-end customer experience. As we enter our eighth holiday season we expect to be more relevant to more holiday shoppers than ever and provide a customer experience better than ever before. Today, our customers around the world can find approximately 9m book titles in five different languages. Customers can now have a power drill or the latest Rolling Stones CD delivered to their home. They can order a printer from Office Depot, ship a blender to a bride and groom from their Amazon wedding registry, buy a shirt from Target, a Harley Barbie from Toys'R'Us, a down comforter from Marshall Fields or a Sony DVD player from J&R Electronics. And soon we'll begin previewing for customers a brand new store that we've been working on for almost a year. We will invest in the long-term success of this new store through heavy on-site promotions this holiday season. 

 In addition to our expanded selection, availability has also improved significantly. We now have over 4m sq. ft. of fulfillment center capacity around the world, which results in a better customer experience with improved delivery times. This year our last day for standard shipping in time for holiday delivery will be even later than it was last year. Last minute shoppers will be able to order on Amazon and pick up products at Circuit City or Borders stores in their local neighborhoods. In-stock availability this holiday season will be at an all-time high, thanks to better inventory planning and management by our team, and to the new and used product offerings from what are now hundreds of thousands of third-party sellers at Amazon.com -- a number that has increased more than four times just in the last 12 months. In Q3 third-party sellers represented an astonishing 23% of all North American units. The liability both on the web site and in terms of delivery to customers has continued to improve each year as evidenced by the 15% YoverY decrease in customer contacts per order in Q3. Historically, we have shipped well in excess of 99% of holiday orders in time to meet holiday deadlines. This year we'll be working hard to eliminate decimal points and push it as high as possible. Finally, our prices will be the lowest ever this holiday. In 1997, we deeply discounted the New York Times' bestseller list. We still do that. But today customer discounts have expanded to include 30% off of virtually all books over $15. In addition, we've significantly lowered prices on electronics, tools and best selling CDs and DVDs. Not only do you get these low product prices, but you get free super saver shipping on orders over $25 too. If you want a used product you can find even lower prices. As I said many times before, we're committed to lowering prices for customers even though it is expensive for us. The primary driver of the nearly 170 basis points sequential reduction in gross margin from Q2 to Q3, on a $45m increase in revenue, was super saver shipping, which was in place for the $49 hurdle and one month at the $25 hurdle. The long-term rewards of relentlessly lowering price, when and as the company can afford to do so, are enormous as increases in unit volume flow across our fixed cost structure. 

 Today we are announcing that we will leave $25 free super saver shipping in place at least through the holidays. Compare that with last year when we had free shipping for a limited time with a much higher hurdle of $99. After the holidays, we'll consider whether we can make $25 free super saver shipping permanent. Price reductions of this magnitude are only made possible by focusing on productivity in every area of the company. 

 In Q3 our pro forma operating expenses remained flat on a 33% increase in revenue. We drove variable cost productivity largely by eliminating mistakes and errors at their root, which also happens to be a huge driver of convenience and experience for customers. Every year that's gone by since Amazon.com's founding we've done a better and better job of eliminating such errors. In addition to variable cost productivity improvements we believe our business is poised to further demonstrate powerful operating leverage. Looking ahead for the foreseeable future we believe we can hold our fixed costs relatively fixed while driving profitable increases in volume over the base. The result is fixed cost productivity that drops straight to the bottom line and becomes available for further price reductions, other kinds of long-term investments and free cash flow generation. 

 Let me spend a moment discussing marketing and communication in the context of a very large customer base. There's always a lag in the customer's brain between reality and perception. It takes time for mass audience perception to catch up with reality. At Amazon.com we're working hard to teach, and our tens of millions of customers are in the process of learning, two new realities about Amazon.com. The first is that our selection has expanded dramatically beyond books, music and video. The second, is that our new pricing strategy saves customers a tremendous amount of money. We've made excellent progress teaching customers about electronics, tools and kitchen products over the last three years. You can see that in this quarter's 39% ETK unit growth. We're really just getting started teaching customers about the unusually significant price reductions and free shipping we've instituted over the last 15 months. Customers understand clearly that Amazon.com is the easiest, most-convenient, most time-efficient way to shop, and most of them do not yet understand that Amazon is also a way to save a significant amount of hard-earned money. Through consistent, persistent messaging and the passage of time we will get that message through over the years, just as we've made progress with ETK awareness. Through relentlessness and patience, perceptions will match reality, and we are excited about that future. 

 Thank you for your time today. Our goal is substantial, sustained growing free cash flow. That interest is aligned perfectly with working hard to serve customers. I look forward to talking with you again in January after what I expect will be a good holiday season. In the meantime, we look forward to serving you while you shop from the comfort of your home or office. And don't forget, you'll be saving money too. And with that I'll turn it over to Mark. 

 MARK PEEK, VP AND CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER, AMAZON.COM: Thanks Jeff, and hello everyone. This was another great quarter for Amazon.com. First, fueled by our continued drive to lower prices, our positive business trends continued. Revenues reached $851m, representing organic growth of 33% compared to the prior year. An acceleration from 21% growth in the first two quarters of the year. Pro forma operating profit was $27m or 3.2% of sales. For the trailing 12 months pro forma operating profit was $137m or 3.8% of sales. Pro forma net income, which of course includes interest expense, was basically at break even compared to a loss of $58m a year ago. For the first time on a trailing 12-month basis, we have pro forma net income of $26m or $0.07 per share. Free cash flow was $120m on the trailing 12 months. A YoverY improvement of over $400m. The combination of common stock outstanding and employee stock-based awards decreased by 2% from a year ago. Trailing 12-month inventory turns were 19 compared to 15 a year ago. 

 Second, our international business continues to exceed our expectations. International segment revenue grew 90% this quarter --the fourth consecutive quarter of greater than 70% growth, and is nearly a billion dollar business on a trailing 12-month basis. Each of our four international web sites experienced YoverY revenue growth exceeding 60% this quarter. For the first time ever, international segment reached break even, a $29m improvement YoverY. 

 Third, our financial progress is also allowing us to invest for the future. We will continue $25 free super saver shipping at least through the holidays, and conduct an extensive marketing and promotion campaign, which includes the new store launch Jeff mentioned earlier. We'll test the impact of paying higher commissions for Q4 to our over 850,000 associate web sites around the world, and we'll continue to find ways to offer the best value proposition for our customers through lower prices, expanded selection and unparalleled convenience. 

 Each of these investments is expensive and negatively impacts profits in the near term. However, unit growth is critical to driving significant increases in cash flows, and therefore, as we have been doing throughout the year, we are willing to forego some current profits to invest for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. 

 Now I would like to discuss our results in more detail. Third quarter revenue was $851m, up 33% from the prior year. As we told you a year ago we believe sales were depressed $25-35m from the events of September 11 in the 3Q01. Adjusting for last year we estimate overall revenue growth exceeding 25%. On a trailing 12-month basis revenue reached $3.6b, an increase of 21%. Active customers, those purchasing in the last 12 months, totaled 29m, a 25% YoverY increase. Gross profit increased by $54m, or 33%, to $216m. Gross margin was flat with the prior year at 25.4%. Gross margin benefited from marketplace, and improvements of inventory management and procurement, offset by significant price reductions to customers, including the cost of free super saver shipping, and as we discussed last quarter, higher margin advertising arrangements representing a lower percentage of our overall revenue mix. 

 Now I'll turn to the segments. Revenue in book, music and video was $412m, an increase of 17%. Despite significant price reductions and foregone shipping revenue, gross profit for the segment was up 25% while gross margin increased over 165 basis points. Continuing to demonstrate the leverage of our model, segment pro forma operating profits increased 64% YoverY to $43m, while operating margin exceeded 10% of sales for the fourth consecutive quarter. In electronics, tools and kitchen revenue increased 25% to $129m on unit growth of 39%. Gross profit for the segment decreased 2% while gross margin was down approximately 280 basis points to 10%. Early in the quarter, through pricing and rebates, we effectively began giving away wireless handsets to drive volume and increase customer activation commissions from wireless service providers. We've seen tremendous customer acceptance of this price reduction as unit volumes almost tripled over the second quarter. This change in strategy negatively impacted margins in ETK during the quarter by approximately 140 basis points, as we deferred recognition of commission revenue from wireless carriers until the fourth quarter when the customer cancellation period lapses. I might add, cell phones are a great holiday gift especially when they're free. 

 We continue to make progress on the bottom line as ETK segment loss improved 27% to $24m, or 19% of sales compared with 32% a year ago. During the quarter, Target significantly expanded the merchandise they make available at Amazon.com, and J&R Electronics brought their extensive selection into our electronics store. In addition, Office Depot has strengthened our office electronics selection of printers, faxes, computer peripherals and computers. 

 International segment revenue reached $264m, an increase of 90% YoverY. Gross profit was $61m, an improvement of $33m or 116%. As previously mentioned, the international segment broke even for the quarter with pro forma operating profit of approximately $800,000, an improvement of nearly $29m YoverY. Compared with the prior year, the dollar was weaker against foreign currencies, resulting in favorable impacts on international segment revenue of approximately $22m, an operating profit of $1m. Including exports, revenue from customers outside the US represented 36% of the company's sales, up from 29% from a year ago. 

 Services revenue was $47m, flat with the prior year, while gross margin was 55%, down from 59% a year ago. As we've mentioned for several quarters, we expect margins will continue to decline near term as our fixed fee higher margin advertising arrangements, originally struck in 1999, represent a lower percentage of our overall revenue mix. Services segment operating profit was $8m. During the quarter we launched an office supplies store with Office Depot. Target.com re-launched their web site powered by Amazon.com, integrating Marshall Fields and Mervyn's into the site, and taking advantage of the personalization and other features customers have come to enjoy while shopping at Amazon.com. 

 We're also very excited with a number of software tools that we designed in connection with the Target.com launch that allow merchandisers to easily display and edit content on the site. We also recently introduced the Amazon.com branded Platinum Visa with Bank One. By using the card for purchases, customers can now earn reward certificates for redemption at Amazon.com. 

 Now moving to the operating expense portion of the income statement. Fulfillment costs were $90m, or 10.6% of sales, down over 210 basis points from 12.7% a year ago. I'd like to remind you that fulfillment includes credit card interchange fees. On sales of third party products the credit card fee is calculated on the gross sale, not our net revenue share. Marketing was $27m, a decline of 18% from a year earlier, due primarily to reduce spending and less efficient channels and lower rates for traffic generation. Pro forma operating profit was $27m vs. a loss of $27m in the third quarter of 2001, an improvement of more than $54m. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of operating profit as our operating margin improved nearly 750 basis points YoverY to 3%. After interest expense pro forma net income was basically at break even and compares to a loss of $58m a year ago. On a trailing 12-month basis, we had pro forma net income of $26m, or $0.07 per share. 

 On a GAAP basis our net loss for the quarter was $35m, or $0.09 per share. This compares with third quarter 2001 net loss of $170m, or $0.46 per share. During the quarter we incurred a restructuring charge of $37m related to revised sublease income estimates for vacant office and fulfillment space. Ongoing lease payments for vacant space and equipment no longer in use will have a negative impact of over $15m on 2003 free cash flow. As you consider our GAAP results keep in mind that each quarter, we mark our Euro denominated debt-to-market. While this had virtually no impact this quarter, it resulted in a $40m charge in third quarter of a year ago. Also during the quarter, we recognized a benefit of $1m for stock-based compensation primarily as a result of the stock price closing slightly below the stock price at June 30, 2002. Last quarter we told you that we would begin expensing employee stock-based awards by the new year and look at improving the form of stock-based awards with the intent of better aligning the interests of employees and shareholders. We've done that, and beginning with next month's annual grant we will largely move from stock options to restricted stock units as the primary stock based award to our employees. This decision will result in a GAAP charge over the vesting period of the restricted stock unit beginning in 4Q. 

 Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow reached $151m, while free cash flow was $120m on a trailing 12-month basis, an improvement of over $400m. When thinking about operating and free cash flow for the full year 2000, you should consider several factors. Predicting the elements of working capital infra-sites is subject to many variables. The highly seasonal nature of our business during the holiday period amplifies the volatility of our working capital at the end of the December quarter. Thus, forecasting the net change in working capital, particularly accounts payable and accrued expenses, is difficult. Additionally, we expect certain suppliers to offer attractive early payment or other discounts near the end of the year. If taking advantage of these offers gives the best economic trade for the company we would sacrifice cash flow for 4Q to achieve better product pricing. 

 Let me move to asset efficiency. Inventory was $152m at quarter end, as we began our inventory build for the holidays. We expect our in-stock levels this holiday season to be our best ever. Inventory turns were 19 on a trailing 12-month basis, an improvement of 31%. We encourage you to compare this metric to other world-class retailers. Our net investment in fixed assets was $239m, a 17% decrease from a year ago. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $866m nearly $200m more than a year ago. 

 I'll conclude my portion of today's call with our guidance for 4Q and some baseline expectations for 2003. Incorporated into our 4Q guidance, and 2003 base-line expectations, are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, we also recognize there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding the global economy, consumer spending and the impact of both of world events. While we are cautiously optimistic about the upcoming holiday season and 2003, it is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Also, when we think about growth we are concerned with only one thing, long-term growth and free cash flow. For the December quarter, we expect net sales of between $1.325-1.425b. We expect our pro forma operating profit to be between $70-95m. When comparing with a year ago, pleas remember that this guidance incorporates $25 free super saver shipping for the entire quarter. For 2003, our baseline expectations are net sales to grow by over 10%, and we expect pro forma operating profit of over $200m. The actual amount we report could be impacted, either positively or negatively, by the long-term investments we choose to make. We cannot provide guidance on our GAAP net income. Let me remind everyone, since certain stock options are currently subject to variable accounting, we incur a charge or gain for any movement in our share price between reporting dates. Also, we mark our Euro denominated debt-to-market at the end of each quarter. The result will either be a non-cash gain or loss. We cannot forecast either of these items yet they could have a significant impact, positively or negatively, on our GAAP results. 

 Before opening it up to questions, let me close with a few final thoughts. First and foremost we are mindful of our customers, and thank them for taking advantage of our selection, convenience and pricing. We strive to always put the customer experience first and we believe that approach drives the best long-term returns to our shareowners. Second, while we are guardedly optimistic, we enter the holiday season with momentum, and we're pleased to be able to increase our guidance. We're again very enthusiastic to serve our customers as we prepare for the holiday season. Third, we are reaping the benefits of scale. While we continue to invest in lower prices and unit growth, we will also measure the progress we make toward our objective of generating significant free cash flow. Finally, all of us at Amazon.com have the same objective -- we are collectively driven to deliver to both our customers and shareowners. Thank you. With that, Tim, let's move to questions. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Great. Thanks Jeff and Mark. With that we'd like to move onto the Q and A portion of the call. In the interest of allowing as many people as possible to ask a question we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Operator, if you could remind our listeners how to ask a question, we'll proceed with the call. 

 OPERATOR: At this time, I would like to remind everyone if you would like to ask a question then please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. The first question comes from Anthony [Nodo] with Goldman Sachs. 

 ANTHONY NODO, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you very much and good afternoon. The company obviously achieved many key important milestones in the quarter. I wanted to look forward and focus on other potential milestones, and as a smaller piece of your business, ETK. As I look at the quarter, I understand the issue with the deferred revenue. I do have one question about where that would occur on the balance sheet. But, more importantly, as we look into 4Q, and I look at your expense level in that business, is it possible that that business breaks even in 4Q based on the YoverY growth rate you're seeing already and then the improvement you'll see in gross margin when you start to recognize that deferred revenue? That's my first question. 

 My second question is, strategically, as you do the different tactics on free shipping, each tactic I can think about either driving frequency or penetration. How do you measure the return on that? The reason that I ask that specifically is that as I look at the June quarter and look at the September quarter you maintained basically the same operating income essentially at a higher revenue base. Did you accelerate your customer growths or your repeat customer growth so that you'll see a return in the future on those free shipping offers because obviously the difference between the two quarters you had about the same operating income on higher revenue. So, how should we think about the return on that free shipping? And does it occur in the future or are you already seeing that in some kind of customer metric? Thank you. 

 JEFF BEZOS: Anthony, this is Jeff. With respect to the ETK segment, and 4Q I assume you mean 4Q of next year, 15 months from now. 

 ANTHONY NODO: Actually, I was referring to this 4Q. Looking at 37... 

 JEFF BEZOS: No. Then it is a very simple question and the answer is no. Was the question could that segment be profitable this 4Q? 

 ANTHONY NODO: Yes. 

 JEFF BEZOS: No. 

 ANTHONY NODO: How should we think about the way the deferred revenue works then? If I was looking at you expense based on your current YoverY growth rate, you know, it looks like it could have been potentially, I guess without this change in the wireless service. 

 MARK PEEK: But, Anthony, the unearned revenue from the wireless business is on the unearned line item in our balance sheet, and 140 basis points to think about as a couple of million dollars of gross profit that will come in next quarter. 

 ANTHONY NODO: OK. Could you give us a perspective of the profitability of that business then in terms of next 4Q? 

 JEFF BEZOS: Well, you're talking about 4Q a year from now. If you look at the fixed costs in that business and its share are allocations and so on, that business needs to grow significantly before it can be profitable. It's possible, let's put it this way, for it be profitable in 4Q a year from now everything has to go right. So, it's possible but everything has to go exactly right. And I certainly wouldn't count on it. And we're not counting on it. 

 And then your second question was about super saver shipping, price reductions in general and how we think about that as an investment. We have a lot of fine grain data about the change in customer behavior with respect to that offer and the other offers we've done, the $49 offer, the $99 offer. And we can see, for example, if you look at order bands, what happens to volume -- how it shifts from orders between $20-25 vs. orders between $25-35. We can look at customers who bought this year and who bought in the same period in the prior year, and see which of those took us up on super saver shipping, which did not, and see what their differences, purchase rates are, how many units they're buying per unit time. We can do a lot of that kind of analysis. We like what we're seeing. We're not ready yet to declare that the $25 hurdle is going to be permanent. We feel good enough about it to declare that we're going to continue it through the holidays. But it is very expensive, and so we're being very deliberate about our decision-making process with respect to that $25 hurdle. We hope to make a final decision on whether or not that can be just a permanent part of our messaging to customers, a permanent part of how we do business, at the end of this year or the beginning of next year, which is in line with our original suggestion that it would take 3-6 months to figure that out. So, we've got a lot of data on that. In any fine grained we don't like to give that data out because we think it is competitively useful. But we certainly know a lot about how customers behave with respect to that kind of offer. The only other thing I would point out is that when you make a change like that, it takes a long time for the knowledge of that whole new price structure to seep into the minds of tens of millions of customers. So, the vast majority of our customers won't even really know, in any real way, about that offer yet. So, it's not changing their behavior. Now what that means is that initially you see more cannibalization than you will over the long term because in the beginning -- people are coming -- they would've bought it anyway, they get to the site and they're like, "Wow! I was going to buy and pay for shipping. I'm going to buy and not pay for shipping. All the better." But that's your opportunity to teach them about this. Then that gives you a chance to dramatically impact their future behavior and your share of their wallet. So, it will literally take years before we see the full benefit of what is a very expensive, but we think worthwhile, investment. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Operator, can we move on to the next question please? 

 OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Mary Meeker with Morgan Stanley. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Are you there? 

 OPERATOR: Speaker your line is open. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Operator maybe we can move on to the next question and if Mary wants to queue back in we'll catch her the next time around. 

 OPERATOR: OK. You're next question is from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank. 

 JEETIL PATEL, ANALYST , DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Hi, guys. A couple of questions. Obviously, international broke even for the first time ever and it looks like a great number. If I recall, it looks like the US business broke even around the same time last year or, I think, 2Q. And since then you've put up some pretty good leverage in that business up to about 5-6% operating margins pretty quickly. Is it safe to assume that we'll see that type of leverage in the international business over the next several quarters going into 2003? Could it be even greater given the growth profile of the international business? 

 Secondly, it seems like you're getting a lot of data points on the free shipping offer out there. And it seems like the holiday season may be the right time to understand if the consumer base is recalling the free shipping over $25 promotion, and if that's working or not. But are you planning any sort of outbound marketing or advertising campaign to reach out to those customers that obviously know about Amazon quite well but haven't been back since the $25 offer has been out there? 

 JEFF BEZOS: Well, I'll take the second one first. This is Jeff. We are testing a television campaign right now. We've been testing it for many months now -- more than six months. And our plan is to continue testing that until we get statistical significance. We're testing it in just two test markets. And one of the things that that campaign does talk about is super saver shipping. So, it's primarily a convenience-oriented campaign, but it does talk about super saver shipping. So we, the other thing, the other vehicle we have that's obviously a very effective one, is the web site itself with roughly 30m visitors a month coming to the web site. We have lots of opportunities on the web site. As we get smart about how to interact with customers on the web site, in terms of teaching them the things we want them to know And that's our other great vehicle for educating folks about what is genuinely a great deal and a great offer. And we definitely want people to know it. The worst thing is having a great offer and kind of paying for it and not having everyone know about it. So it's definitely in our interest that everyone knows about that. Feel free to put it in your research reports. 

 But I do -- we'll continue to test the broad scale advertising. We're trying to do it very methodically so we actually know whether it's working. We don't want to spend a lot of money on that unless we're pretty sure that it is working. So we'll continue to do the testing. And then on-site is a huge opportunity for us just because we have so much traffic on our web site, and that's obviously been very cost effective for us. 

 MARK PEEK: Yeah, and Jeetil on the international side, certainly with these types of growth rates, we're going to drive a lot of fixed cost leverage. That said, we know that these growth aren't sustainable forever, and that when you're right at break-even, there is a chance that you will go back and forth around that number for some time. But we certainly expect our international business to be profitable in the future. And we also will make investments in the international business because they make sense again with the objective of driving long-term free cash flow growth for one (phonetic). 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks, [Jeetil]. Operator can we take the next call please? 

 OPERATOR: The next question comes from Lenny Baker with Salomon Smith Barney. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Lenny are you there? 

 OPERATOR: Lenny's line has been removed. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Great. Can we move on to the next question? 

 OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Mark [Mahenny] from Morgan Stanley. 

 MARY MEEKER, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Is this the line? Can you hear us? 

 TIM HALLADAY: Mary, we can hear you. 

 MARY MEEKER: Thanks. We have an echo so I apologize for that. I'm sorry we were muted last time. A couple of questions. Could you tell us a little about your expectations are for revenue per customer, trends in the 4Q trend? Do you think you'll see more new customer ads? Or given the education you're trying to do of your customers, do you think you'll see more older customers buying more products, and how we should philosophically think about that for our models? 

 And then the second question, relates to you've really been hawks on efficiency and productivity in the last years. I'd characterize it after being whales. And as you look at the model on a go forward basis do you think you'll see an inflection point for leverage in '03 or '04? And I guess it's the question is pick a year specifically related to volume and growth in third party sales. Thanks. Are you there? 

 JEFF BEZOS: Yeah. We're -- sorry, we're allocating the questions. 

 MARY MEEKER: This is mute vs. mute? Ha ha. 

 JEFF BEZOS: Sorry what was the first question? Well right. In the US we would expect to see new customer, some of both, new customer acquisition and a greater share of wallet of existing customers. That's certainly what we're hoping for. That's what we are -- the things we've been doing are designed to have that happen. Outside the US it will still be some of both, but it should be weighted a little bit more toward new customers, just because we're not as deeply penetrated there and also because we haven't introduced as many new product categories outside the US as we have inside the US. So, but, it should definitely be some of both. 

 MARY MEEKER: Well for the older customers, do you have any targets on how much you would want to see the revenue per customer go up in the 4Q? Because it's a new approach. You have a lot of new product, much better pricing, etc. 

 JEFF BEZOS: Most of our targets are set by product line or by feature set. They're not set by frequency of customer or -- we do segment our customer base. We look at the data that way but we don't set targets that way internally. Mostly because the business owners, the way we have the business organized, the business owners don't own segments of customers, they tend to own categories of products and various features sets. 

 MARK PEEK: And Mary, with respect to our cost structure you mention whale and I'm not sure if you meant the large, fat marine mammal. 

 MARY MEEKER: Just kidding. 

 MARK PEEK: or getting whaled upside the head on our cost structure. But we continue to believe that we will be able to drive productivity on our fixed cost base for the foreseeable future and it will have variable cost productivity going forward. 

 MARY MEEKER: OK. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks, Mary. Operator can we take the next question please? 

 OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Justin [Valdolf] with Merrill Lynch. 

 JUSTIN VALDOLF, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: Much congratulations on a nice quarter. A quick question -- a follow-up question really on free shipping. I'm wondering if you can tell us the information that's typically disclosed in your SEC filings, which is shipping revenues and shipping profits for the quarter. And if you could comment roughly on what first orders were eligible for free shipping, and then what percentage of those eligible orders actually took advantage of the program. 

 And then another question just in terms of the used business, I think it was 23% of North American units for the quarter, up from 20% last quarter. Can you talk about what categories that business is particularly strongest in, and whether or not there are significant opportunities to expand it into the site more broadly? 

 MARK PEEK: Yeah, sure. On shipping revenue for the quarter it was approximately $73m this 3Q vs. $74m a year ago. And our shipping loss for the quarter was $10m, vs. a loss of $2m in 3Q of last year. 

 TIM HALLADAY: For your information, that is in the back of the press release so anybody on the call can go find that at the back of the press release. And remind us of your second question. 

 JUSTIN VALDOLF: Oh, my second one was just about the used business, 23% of units in the quarter. Where do you think that plateaus and where is that strongest today in terms of product category? 

 JEFF BEZOS: Where that will be, kind of what the natural point is, it's 23% of units now, whether over time it should be a higher percentage or a lower percentage or how that's going to shape up, is, I think, very hard to know. And our approach to this has been to set the commission rates in such a way that, more or less, we are indifferent to whether we sell a used unit or a new unit. And then just put them both up there and let the customers decide what fraction of the business is going to be. But we're sort of indifferent to -- we're largely indifferent to the outcome. And, so, I think forecasting that, I wouldn't want to do it. I wouldn't know how to go about doing it. It's very untested and it has -- you'd have to make a lot of assumptions about future consumer behavior that I don't think anybody on this planet really knows, and we're seeing good take up of that, good coverage with listings, good seller velocity, and so on across different categories. Clearly, very strong in books but also very strong in electronics. So we're very happy about that. 

 JUSTIN VALDOLF: And you typically report the penetration from North America. Can you talk about what the used penetration is internationally? 

 JEFF BEZOS: We're very happy with what we've seen. What I can tell you is that if you look at the equivalent period of time, the launches internationally have been even more successful than the launches in the US. So, if you look - if the launches internationally are six months old now, if you look at the six-month point in the US, you see that the international units have made more progress in their first six months than the US did in the equivalent amount of time. These are -- as far as I can remember -- our fastest product launches ever. The business is doing very, very well. We're very excited about it. The international units, the international teams are very excited about it. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks, Justin. Operator, can you make this our last question please? 

 OPERATOR: The next question comes from Derrick Brown with WR Hembrecht. 

 DERRICK BROWN, ANALYST, WR HEMBRECHT: Thanks. I've actually got a follow up question on the used business. In particular, could you maybe help to give a sense for what level, if any, of cannibalization you're seeing in your direct sales from used sales? And also helping us to understand your kind of inventorying strategy around the used market, if you have a difficult time forecasting where that percentage moves in terms of percentage of units? 

 JEFF BEZOS: With respect to your first question, the studies we've done have shown that the people who are purchasing used product from us are actually purchasing even more new product from us subsequent to their used purchases. So it's not at all clear that we're seeing any cannibalization. It's, of course, very difficult to ever know with certainty what's going on there. But the data that we've done looking at customers and their behavior before and after used, is very, very positive in that respect, which is not surprising to me because it basically makes our whole service more valuable. Whenever you do something that customers like, something they appreciate, something that they use, like our marketplace business that reflects well on the entire company, and you just get more share of wallet from those customers. So very, very pleased about that. 

 And the second piece of your question was what again? 

 DERRICK BROWN: Just understanding how demands on the used side may or may not be impacting your inventory strategies for the direct side of your business. 

 JEFF BEZOS: Well. It actually hasn't impacted our -- I would say one of the things that happens is that the used product has been layered in sort of over time enough that all of our computer systems and the people who do the inventory for planning have been able to adjust. But since our business has been growing it really hasn't been an issue, those people have been buying more inventory. 

 DERRICK BROWN: Great. Thank you. 

 JEFF BEZOS: You're welcome. 

 TIM HALLADAY: Thanks, Derrick. With that I want to thank everyone for joining us the call today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available on our investor relations web site through the end of the quarter. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. And thanks for your interest in Amazon.com. Bye for now. 

 JEFF BEZOS: Bye, bye you guys. Thank you.

Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons used in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2001. 

 With that introduction, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. 

 JEFF BEZOS, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMAZON.COM:  Thanks Tim.  Good afternoon everyone. 

 We're very excited about our results this quarter and especially pleased with the outstanding job our books team's doing, posting another quarter of 20 percent year-over-year book unit growth, up from 15 percent growth this past fourth quarter. 

 While the music business has been challenging for everyone, our resurgence in books has been able to temper the impact.  Also, electronics, tools and kitchen revenues reaccelerated with customer experience enhancements such as lower prices and increased selection. 

 Since the beginning of the year, electronic selection expanded 40 percent to over 60,000 items including authorized product from industry leaders such as Sony, Toshiba, Microsoft and Yamaha. 

 Our International business also continues to execute with trailing 12-month revenues reaching 845 million and revenue growth still exceeding 70 percent.  As far as our top line performance has been, you should also be assured to look at the bottom line results where we've made even more progress. 

 With the remainder of my time today, I'd like to talk primarily about two things, our strategy of relentlessly lowering price and the success of our third party business.  Let me talk first about price. The results this quarter are a third consecutive data point that lowering prices is working for us. 

 Let me put this in context, last July after nearly two years spent almost exclusively focused on lowering our cost structure, we reached a point where we could afford to balance growth and cost improvement. At that time we increased the discount on books over $20 to 30 percent off. Then in January, we introduced a year-round free shipping option on orders over $99.  In April, we lowered the threshold for the 30 percent discount to $15 and just a month ago; we introduced a long-term test, which lowers the threshold for free super saver shipping to $49. 

 In addition to the highly visible changes, during the first half of this year we've also been sharpening prices on many items throughout the store particularly in electronics and DVDs. 

 Lowering price for customers along with driving selection and convenience are the pillars of our strategy and it's working.  As evidence, look to the results from each of our last three quarters. As you probably would have expected following our various pricing actions over the last year, our sales growth reaccelerated to 15 percent growth in Q4 and 21 percent growth in the most recent two quarters.  However, what may not have been expected is that our operating margins would increase at such a rapid pace reaching 3.2 percent of sales in Q2 an increase of over 740 basis points year-over-year.  On a trailing 12-month basis, our pro forma operating profit was $82 million or 2.4 percent of sales, an improvement of over $285 million year-over-year. 

 In Q2, even with lower book prices, sharper pricing in many of our non-media stores and free super saver shipping, you saw significantly improved operating results.  Books, music and video operating profit increased 26 percent, reaching a record 12 percent operating margin an increase of nearly 150 basis points from Q1 on seasonally lower sales. 

 Equally impressive, our ETK sales continue to reaccelerate from the eight percent growth in Q1 to 16 percent growth in Q2 while ETK segment losses improved 55 percent.  Customers are continuing to learn that Amazon.com is an excellent choice not only for media but for electronics, tools and kitchen as well. 

 Price reductions are a big deal to customers but can be expensive for Amazon.com in the short-term.  For example, we expect our current test of free super saver shipping with the $49 threshold to have a negative impact on Q3 margins as customers take advantage of lower prices in advance of offsetting incremental demand.  However, over the long-term, the rewards of relentlessly lowering price when and as the company can afford to do so are enormous as increases in unit volume flow across our fixed cost structure.  We make such price reductions possible by focusing on productivity in every area of the company. 

 In Q2 our pro forma operating expenses decreased seven percent on a 321 percent increase in revenue.  Let me give you some examples of how we achieved this.  Pro forma expense was 10.6 percent of sales, an improvement from the prior year of almost 220 basis points.  One of the most important things we've done to improve variable costs productivity also happens to be a huge driver of convenience and experience for customers, eliminating mistakes and errors at their root. 

 Every year that's gone by since Amazon.com's founding, we've done a better and better job of eliminating errors.  This quarter our U.S. fulfillment centers drove a nearly 50 percent reduction in their controllable defects.  Worldwide units shipped per labor hour improved 22 percent year-over-year and worldwide customer service contacts per order declined 30 percent from the prior year primarily because when you do things right the first time customers don't need to contact you. 

 Inventory turns continue to increase and are now 19 on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 35 percent year-over-year.  As you would expect, this high number of inventory turns reduces liquidation's and improves capital velocity both of which save us money. 

 We've also seen a substantial improvement in technology expense, which was 7.2 percent of sales in Q2, a decline over a year ago of almost 250 basis points as a result of several factors including moving to a more efficient hardware platform. 

 In addition to our improvements in variable cost productivity, we believe our business is poised to further demonstrate its powerful operating leverage.  Looking ahead for the foreseeable future, we believe we can largely hold our fixed costs fixed while driving profitable increases in volume over the base.  The result is fixed cost productivity that drops straight to the bottom line and becomes available for further price reductions band the best news of all, is that we believe we can continue to drive both fixed and variable productivity for years to come allowing us to continue returning those savings to customers in the form of lower prices. 

 Now, let me move on to our third party business, which includes both our marketplace sellers and our merchant SAT service partners.  About two years ago we started our third party services business with Toys-R-Us.com.  A few months later as part of our single store strategy we first offered customers the opportunity to shop for used products right along side new ones.  Since those first introductions, momentum with third party sellers has taken off as big sellers like Target and Circuit City have added apparel, kitchen, electronics and other selection to our highly trafficked product detail pages. 

 That our customers love the added selection is evidenced by our over 30 million visitors a month and the fact that in Q2 an astonishing 20 percent of U.S. units, representing 35 percent of all U.S. orders were purchased from third party sellers, often from customers that had not previously bought from Amazon.com.  In the last year over 40 percent of the people who made purchases at Amazon.com bought from one of our third party sellers. 

 Also, our marketplace business in Germany and the U.K. is growing approximately twice as fast as the U.S. marketplace business was four months after its launch.  As you would imagine our customers around the world love the increased selection our third party business provides. 

 And before I turn it over to Mark, let me talk about one last topic. We've made the decision to begin expensing stock options and other stock-based awards.  This'll take effect by the beginning of 2003. The best thing about expensing stock options is that it opens the door to more carefully crafted equity incentives.  For example, today in order to avoid expensing stock options under current accounting rules, strike prices must be set at the date of grant. 

 In a volatile stock market employees that start just days apart can have dramatically different strike prices.  A much more rational system of studying the strike price would be to average the price over a 30-day period following the start of employment.  However, any company that would take that more rational approach would be forced to expense the stock options.  This is just one small example.  Our decision to expense stock options also opens the door to thinking about ideas such as restricted stock and indexed options that might better align the incentives of employees with shareholders.  Employee ownership was one of the founding tenets of Amazon.com and without a doubt one of the major reasons Amazon.com has been successful to date is our broad commitment to employee ownership.  That commitment won't change. 

 And with that I'll turn it to Mark. 

 MARK PEAK (ph), VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER, AMAZON.COM:  Thanks Jeff and hello everyone. 

 This was another great quarter for Amazon.com.  First, our positive business trends continued.  Revenue growth exceeded 20 percent for the second consecutive quarter, reaching $806 million.  Pro forma operating profit was $26 million or 3.2 percent of sales.  For the trailing 12 months, pro forma operating profit reached $82 million or 2.4 percent of sales.  Pro forma net loss, which includes interest expense, was $4 million or a penny per share compared with a loss of 16 cents per share a year ago.  Free cash flow was $16 million on a trailing 12-month basis, a year-over-year improvement of $285 million.  Adjusted free cash flow, which is reduced for capital lease payments, was essentially break even on a trailing 12-month basis.  Common stock outstanding was 380 million shares at June 30th, an increase of five percent compared with the prior year with approximately half of the increase related to a $100 million investment by America Online one year ago.  Trailing 12-month inventory turns were 19, an increase of 35 percent. 

 Second, as Jeff discussed, our success continued in our third party business.  Our customers, both buyers and sellers, love the service. 

 Third, the productivity loop works.  Productivity has given us the flexibility to invest in lower prices to customers.  New product offerings like Marketplace and Amazon.ca our Canadian Web site, while continuing improves our financial performance. 

 We are very pleased with the quarter but we recognize there is still much to do.  We must continue to improve the customer experience, continue to drive cost productivity and continue to increase demand by offering a compelling value proposition to our customers. 

 Now I'd like to discuss our results in more detail Q2 performance trends.  Second quarter revenue was $806 million, up 21 percent from the prior year.  Active customers, those purchasing in the last 12 months total 27 million, a 30 percent year-over-year increase.  Gross profit increased by $38 million or 21 percent to $218 million.  Gross margin was up 16 basis points to 27.1 percent exceeding 27 percent for the first time.  Gross margin improved primarily as a result of Marketplace sales, improvements in procurement and transportation related savings and was partially offset by price reductions to customers including the cost of free super saver shipping.  As a result of inbound freight savings and shipment injections, we were able to cover the cost of lost revenue related to our $99 super saver-shipping offer allowing us to migrate to our current $49 offer. 

 Now I'll turn to the segments.  Revenue in the books, music and video segment was $412 million, an increase of six percent.  Books unit growth was 20 percent, offset by the industry trend of slow growth in our music business.  Despite significant price reductions and foregone shipping revenue, gross profit for the segment was up 12 percent while gross margin reached an all-time high of 30 percent. 

 Segment pro forma operating profit was $49 million, up 26 percent year-over-year while operating margin also increased to a record 12 percent of sales.  On a trailing 12-month basis-operating margin for the segment reached 11 percent, a year-over-year increase of over 300 basis points. 

 In June, Virgin Entertainment Group of North America re-launched its U.S. Web site, Virginmega.com as a co-branded book, music and video store powered by our e-commerce platform.  Later this year, Virgin will re-launch their Japanese Web site, which will be powered by Amazon.co.jp. 

 Additionally, we recently launched our Canadian Web site, Amazon.ca. By selecting Assured Logistics, a part of the Canada Post group of companies to handle fulfillment services we were able to launch Amazon.ca in a capital efficient manner.  We are offering access to a growing selection of 1.5 million book, music and video titles in both English and French.  Additionally, our Canadian customers will receive introductory free shipping on orders over 75 Canadian dollars.  Early feedback is positive.  Our Canadian customers love their newfound convenience, selection at low prices and much faster delivery times. 

 ETK, in electronics, tools and kitchen, revenue increased 16 percent to $128 million.  Gross profit for the segment increased 41 percent while gross margin was up over 250 basis points to 14 percent.  The ETK segment loss declined 55 percent to $18 million or 14 percent of sales compared with 37 percent a year ago. 

 During the quarter we became a Sony authorized Internet reseller for digital cameras and camcorders, PDA handhelds, computers and monitors. Additionally, we opened authorized relationships with Microsoft and Toshiba plus Yamaha's home theater product line.  Thus, since December 31st, our electronics selection has increased nearly 40 percent to over 60,000 items. 

 International.  International segment revenue reached $218 million. The third consecutive quarter of 70 percent or better year-over-year increases.  Gross profit was $47 million, an improvement of $18 million or 61 percent.  International segment pro forma operating loss declined 66 percent to $10 million, an improvement of $20 million compared with the prior year.  Although the dollar was weaker against European currency versus the first quarter, on a year-over-year, the impact of exchange rates on our International segment revenue was less than $100,000. 

 While International growth rates must ultimately slow we continue to be optimistic about this segment.  In the U.K. and Germany, we are finding that sellers and customers are as enthusiastic about our Marketplace offering as they are in the United States. 

 Additionally, with new forms of payment, such as cash-on-delivery in Japan and invoicing in Germany we are attracting many new customers. In Japan we surpassed one million active customer accounts during the quarter. 

 Including exports, International revenue represented 34 percent of the company sales, up from 28 percent a year ago. 

 Services.  Service revenue increased $8 million or 22 percent to $47 million while our gross margin was 61 percent, down from 68 percent a year ago.  We expect margins will continue to decline over the year as our fixed fee, higher margin advertising arrangements originally struck in 1999 represent a lower percentage of our overall revenue mix. Segment operating profit was $6 million, a 29 percent increase over the prior year. 

 Last week we started providing shopping functionality for AOL customers.  Over the next several months we will launch Target.com, powered by Amazon.com and expand the selection of Target products at Amazon.com. 

 Now moving to the operating expense portion of the income statement. Fulfillment costs were $86 million or 10.6 percent of sales, down approximately 220 basis points from 12.8 percent a year ago. 

 Marketing was $29 million, a decline of 17 percent from a year earlier due primarily to our move to more efficient means of advertising and reductions in the rates that we are paying for traffic generation. 

 Pro forma operating profit was $26 million versus the loss of $28 million in the second quarter of 2001, an improvement of $54 million. This was our third consecutive quarter of operating profits.  Our operating margin improved 740 basis points to three percent.  Pro forma net loss, which includes interest expense, was $4 million or a penny per share compared with a loss of 16 cents per share a year ago. 

 On a GAAP basis, our net loss for the quarter was $94 million or 25 cents per share.  This compares with a second quarter 2001 net loss of $168 million or 47 cents per share.  As you consider our GAAP results keep in mind that each quarter that we mark our Euro denominated debt-to-market, which resulted in a charge of $71 million in the second quarter.  We also recognized an expense of $23 million for stocks-based compensation primarily as the result of the upward movement in our share price. 

 Cash flow.  Trailing 12-month operating cash flow reached $48 million, an improvement of over $200 million.  While free cash flow was $16 million on a trailing 12-month basis, an improvement of $285 million year-over-year. 

 Let me move to asset efficiency.  Ending inventory of $127 million reached its lowest level since September 1999 while our ability to serve customers with in-stock selection continues to get better. Inventory turns were 29 on a trailing 12-month basis, an improvement of 35 percent.  We encourage you to use this metric to other world-class retailers; it is truly an astonishing achievement. 

 At June 30th, prepaid and other current assets increased approximately $20 million because a credit card service provider unintentionally failed to make a scheduled payment.  Our net investment in fixed assets was $250 million, a 15 percent decrease from a year ago. 

 We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $824 million.  Please note that we received proceeds from employee stock options of $43 million during the quarter.  These proceeds were excluded from our measurement of operating and free cash flows. 

 I'll conclude my portion of today's call with our guidance for Q3 and an update on our guidance for the year.  Incorporated into our Q3 and 2002 guidance are the results that we have seen to date and what we believe, today, to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, we also recognize that it is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 

 Also, when we think about growth, we are concerned with only one thing, long-term growth and free cash flow. 

 Now to the guidance.  For the September quarter we expect net sales of between $780 and $830 million.  We expect our pro forma operating profit to be between $8 million and $17 million.  When comparing to Q2, please remember that our $49 super saver-shipping offer ran for only the last two weeks of the quarter. 

 For the full year, we expect net sales to grow by over 18 percent.  We expect pro forma net income, which means we will cover our interest expense for the year.  We also expect to spend approximately $50 million in cap ex and finally we expect to generate free cash flow for the year. 

 We cannot provide guidance on our GAAP net income.  Let me remind everyone since we expense certain stock options we incur a charge or gain for any movement in our share price between reporting dates.  As Jeff mentioned, we also intend to expense future stock options and other stock-based compensation beginning no later than January 2003. This will impact the accounting for equity awards granted after that time. 

 Also, we mark our Euro denominated debt-to-market at the end of each quarter.  The result will be either a non-cash gain or loss.  We cannot forecast either of these items, yet they could have a significant impact either positively or negatively on our GAAP results. 

 Before opening it up to questions, let me close with a few final thoughts.  First and foremost we are mindful of our customers and thank them for taking advantage of our selection, convenience and pricing.  We strive to always put the customer experience first.  We believe that approach drives the best long-term returns for our shareowners. 

 Second, we enter the back half of 2002 with momentum and we're pleased to be able to increase our guidance for the remainder of the year. 

 Third, we are reaping the benefits of scale.  We will continue to invest in lower prices but we will also measure the progress we make toward our objective of generating significant free cash flow. 

 Finally, all of us at Amazon.com have the same objective.  We are collectively driven to deliver for both our customers and shareowners. Thanks and with that Tim, let's move to questions. 

 TIM HALLIDAY (ph):  Great.  Thanks Jeff and Mark. 

 With that we'd like to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.  In the interest of allowing as many people as possible to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. 

 Operator, if you could remind our listeners how to ask a question, we'll proceed with the call. 

 OPERATOR:  At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. 

 We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. 

 Your first question comes from Sean Milne (ph) of  Soundview Technologies (ph). 

 SEAN MILNE (ph), SOUNDVIEW TECHNOLOGIES:  Thank you and good afternoon. 

 Jeff, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about the used products business, obviously another very big quarter there, clearly trading top line growth for better margin.  What's your expectation for the business in the next couple quarters?  Does it grow as a percent of BMV or do you think we're going to top out at the current level?  Any additional color would be great.  Thank you. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  Well certainly that business, the Marketplace business grew very rapidly this quarter and we expect it to continue to grow. You know, I'd love to see our retail business also growing so fast but in terms of mix that, you know, there's good competition there. 

 So, you know, what we're really driving for is unit growth.  We don't really care whether those units are Marketplace units or whether they are owned inventory units and so we've tried to price those things so that we are, you know, more or less indifferent to which kind of unit get sold and then we just let the Marketplace the way it will. 

 I do expect it to continue and certainly outside the U.S. where those businesses are just getting started, you know, our early experience would indicate that we're going to have the same kind of success there outside the U.S. that we've had inside the U.S. but, you know, we'll have to wait and see for sure but that's certainly what it looks like right now. 

 SEAN MILNE (ph):  Thank you. 

 TIM HALLIDAY (ph):  Thanks Sean (ph), can we take the next question please? 

 OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Jiteal Bitell (ph) of Deutsche Bank Securities. 

 JITEAL BITELL (ph), DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES:  Hey guys, obviously quite a bit of success on the retail side, on the BMV side in particular and the Marketplace side. 

 I guess - have you guys thought about or have you talked about any sort of timing as it relates to the technology platform to open it up to obviously a broad class of sellers that, you know, fit the current categories that you're addressing and outside of - or categories also that you're not addressing from a Marketplace standpoint?  I guess from a technology standpoint, are ready to handle that type of load and you know is there timeframe that you start to look in broadening the overall platform? 

 JEFF BEZOS:  Well we've been - it's a very good question and we've been working now for probably almost three years building the various tools that sellers use on our platform today.  You know we've done a huge amount of build out over the last nine months or so preparing for the Target.com launch, which is coming up and there are on our list of projects to do, still a large number of projects that we'll sort of do what you're talking about.  Sort of upgrade the platform to make it easier for parties of all kinds to sell right along side us on our own detail pages where the 30 million visitors and that's the U.S. number by the way.  The worldwide number is much larger, the monthly visitor number. 

 So the basic answer to your question is we're not there yet.  We're not where we want to be.  We've made huge progress over the last couple of years.  There's a huge amount of progress still to come in terms of upgrading our systems to make it really great for third party sellers. It's working today.  It can be much better.  We know what we have to do and we've got good people working on it. 

 TIM HALLIDAY (ph):  Thanks Jiteal (ph).  Operator can we take the next question, please? 

 OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Mary Meager (ph) of Morgan Stanley. 

 MARY MEAGER (ph), MORGAN STANLEY:  Thanks, Mark and I just have a couple simple questions. 

 Jeff, could you provide a little more color on unit growth?  You talked about the book business but if you could provide us some color across the difference business lines that would be great and do you have any customer growth objectives you're willing to share with us? Thanks. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  No, the only unit growth figure that we're giving out is for books.  We are - we'll be giving, you know, sort of spot figures from time to time to give people insight into various businesses but we're not intending to make it a regular practice of giving out the unit growth figures on a segment-by-segment or product category-by-product category business. 

 In terms of guidance on customer growth, you know, in a similar vein we certainly would expect customer growth to continue but we're not going to get into the habit either of giving guidance on any of our line items or on customer growth. 

 MARY MEAGER (ph):  OK.  Thanks. 

 TIM HALLIDAY (ph):  Thank you Mary.  Operator can we take the next question, please? 

 OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Antony Noto (ph) of Goldman Sachs. 

 ANTONY NOTO (ph), GOLDMAN SACHS:  Two questions really. 

 The first is, could you walk through how the customer behavior has changed sort of in three phases when you initially went to the free shipping offer, the before and after period and then when you went to the $49 hurdle rate just recently?  I know it's only been five weeks but did you see a change in penetration growth across those three phases as well as average order size and then, secondly, philosophically, I know that you've debated internally managing both growth and profitability and we've gone through phases of focusing on each and now it's a balance of both.  As I look at the quarter's results you came in above the high end of your revenue expectations, which is the mid-point of the range was like 790 so you're above that.  You had record level gross margins of 27 percent.  You launched the free shipping offer with two weeks left in the quarter, which says you've decided, you know, spend back on growth a little bit. 

 As we look into Q3 and you give guidance of a record growth rate since, you know, fourth quarter of 2000 you're forecasting middle of the range growth of 26 percent, which you haven't done since the fourth quarter of 2000, if you get through the quarter and you're showing strong momentum there, will you continue to spend back on growth to stay within your range or will you try to really drive to the bottom line? Thanks. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  Good questions. 

 The main thing that we've seen with the - you're right to point out it's only been a few weeks with the $49 super saver shipping and we said at the time that we would do that probably for three to six months while we assessed it because one of the things we know about these kinds of offers is that you have to be very cautious about how you interpret the early results.  It takes time for the word to spread, that you can get free shipping when, you know, only have to buy $49 worth of stuff and you can get free shipping.  Takes time for people to learn that and so on and so on. 

 So it is way early to comment on it.  You know early one of the things just to give you some color that we've seen is that it has impacted certain product categories more than others and we've seen that kind of behavior before but we noticed it a little bit more with the $49 super saver shipping test.  So we're studying that behavior trying to figure out what we can learn from it so that it can help us, you know, pick our next steps. 

 In terms of the balance between growth and profitability, what we basically internally we have certain minimum unit growth rates that we're trying to generate and we are, you know, constrained by being able to afford to do so we think one of the most effective ways to hit those unit growth rate targets is by using price as a lever.  So it can be product price or it can be things like super saver shipping but we have, you know, for each of our sort of product categories we have unit growth rates that we think are appropriate and we're trying to, you know, adjust our business to achieve those growth rates and then we have a very hard constraint on the minimum amount of free cash flow that we're willing to accept over time and we balance off those two things against each other.  So that's the way we think about those kinds of decisions. 

 ANTONY NOTO (ph):  So is it fair to say philosophically when you give a revenue guidance range you're basically going to manage to -- you're not manage above the high end of that range unless you're significantly beat the bottom line because you want to basically manage both. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  We don't have -- I think one of the things that your question might assume is that we have sort of very short-term control over the revenue bottom line trade-off and I would not think about our business that way.  So for example, when you sell off through the $49 super saver shipping offer in the last two weeks of the quarter, that was not designed to try and increase revenues in that quarter or anything like that.  That just happened to be the time that we were ready to do that test. 

 And indeed, you know, what we find is that when you reduce price generally it takes time for the elasticity result that you're looking for to creep in to that decision and we've learned something about that price elasticity.  But these things are not fine tuneable in periods of time measured on weeks.  You know it's the kind of thing that we can figure out measured over months and quarters. 

 ANTONY NOTO (ph):  Great.  Thank you very much. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  Thank you. 

 TIM HALLIDAY (ph): Tthank you Antony (ph).  Operator, can we take the next question, please? 

 OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Market Roland (ph) of Prudential Securities. 

 MARKET ROLAND (ph), PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES:  Thank you. 

 Jeff, you had a full quarter of lowering the book discounts to 30 percent off on books of $15 and above, can you give us a sense of the elasticity there and is there more room to go?  Is there more elasticity if you drop that to say, $10 or all books or is $15 kind of the bottom end of where the elasticity ends and then could you also tie that into the early results you're seeing from the $49 freight hurdle and what that's done to elasticity so far?  Thank you. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  So in response to the first part of that, there certainly would be -- we know enough about now I think we can safely say that, you know, we think there would be elasticity if you were to take that 30 percent off hurdle down to $10 or $5 or zero.  Yes, you would see elasticity there. 

 The problem with doing that is that then you run risk of making those units on sort of a per unit basis unprofitable.  So when you look at the variable cost of handling a unit, it costs us about the same to handle a $7 paperback as it does to handle a $30 hardcover and so obviously when you look at the number of gross profit dollars that you have left over after applying a 30 percent discount you have a lot more gross profit dollars if you're doing that to an expensive item than you do to a very inexpensive item. 

 So it's not so much whether there would be elasticity if we were to take that hurdle down from $15 to $5 that would be there.  I feel very confident about that.  The problem would be that I'm not sure those units would then be profitable and so you'd get a skewed behavior of customers.  They would choose those units.  They would buy more of those units and you might not be making money on them so it's not clear that you want to sell a lot of those units. 

 MARKET ROLAND (ph):  So basically the $15 then is sort of getting towards the bottom end of the range where is if you discounted books lower than that your gross profit dollars might not be higher even though you're gross profit margins would be lower as it has been when you lowered it on $20 books? 

 JEFF BEZOS:  I suspect that $15 is somewhere around the right level. Whether it's exactly the right level or whether it can still come down some, you know, I guess I wouldn't want to comment on that, leave ourselves some flexibility there but certainly I don't think it would ever go down to zero.  I think that would be too far. 

 And then, what was the second part? 

 MARKET ROLAND (ph):  Just early comments on the elasticity of the $49 freight hurdle and also if you could sort of run through the same analysis with that, whether it in fact will give you more gross profit dollars even though a lower margin? 

 JEFF BEZOS:  Well it's still too early to know what kind of offsetting volume we're going to get with the $49.  So we need more.  We're going to continue this experiment and see what we learn over the next, you know, two to five months and but what I can tell you is in just the first few weeks of this quarter and, you know, it's very, very early and so I wouldn't want people to extrapolate from this but we are seeing, you know, we are continuing to see good books unit growth in the first few weeks of this quarter. 

 MARKET ROLAND (ph):  Thank you. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  Thank you. 

 TIM HALLIDAY (ph):  Thanks Mark.  Operator, can we take the next question, please and we'll take two more questions. 

 OPERATOR:  Your next question comes from Justin Baldoff (ph) of Merrill Lynch. 

 JUSTIN BALDOFF (ph), MERRILL LYNCH:  Hi, thanks a lot and congrats on a great quarter. 

 Just a quick question, if you could comment on the competitive environment and if some of the other retailers and e-tailers (ph) have recently lowered - have introduced free shipping programs of their own, I know there's been some quite a bit of press about price wars. Have you been able to gauge any impact from any of those competitive moves? Thanks. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  Well I think the best thing I can tell you there - well first of all a little bit of background, you know, we definitely consider ourselves the leaders in this particular space and we are proactive about setting our own pricing agenda.  So you know, we think we understand elasticity and customer behavior in response to price better than anybody out there.  We've just been doing it a long time. We've been thinking about it a lot.  I think we understand it very well. We have a ton of data from our very large customer base.  We get to see results from experiments much faster than anybody else in a statistically significant way because of that large customer base and high sales.  So we think we know a lot about that.  We're definitely setting those prices the way we think they should be set and then in terms of, you know, have we seen any impact on this, I think the best thing I can share with you is the thing I just said a few seconds ago, which is that in the first few weeks here of this new quarter, even though it is very, very early to be sure, we are very pleased with the continued book unit growth that we've seen. 

 JUSTIN BALDOFF (ph):  Great.  Thanks a lot. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  Thank you. 

 TIM HALLIDAY (ph):  Thanks Justin.  Operator, can we make this our last question, please? 

 OPERATOR:  Yes sir, your final question comes Jeff Feeler (ph) of Bear Stearns. 

 JEFF FEELER (ph), BEAR STEARNS:  Hi.  I guess I'll let Mark answer a question.  It seems like Jeff's been taking most of them. 

 Question for you Mark is, if you have expensed stock options this quarter as you're planning to do beginning in 2003, do you have an estimate of what the impact would be on both the - I guess just the income statement? 

 MARK PEAK (ph):  Jeff I don't and as you know we do expense stock options from the exchange offer that we made in the first quarter of 2001.  As Jeff pointed out, what we're looking at is a number of ways to offer equity instruments be they options or whatever the instrument might be and until we spend a bit more time studying what we'll do in the future it's hard for us to predict what the future impact will be. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  Well except to say that it will be negative. 

 MARK PEAK (ph):  Definitely it will be negative. 

 JEFF FEELER (ph):  All right.  Fair enough. 

 TIM HALLIDAY (ph):  Jeff thanks. 

 With that I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available on our investor relations Web site through the end of the quarter.  We look forward to talking to you again next quarter and thanks for your interest in Amazon.com. 

 Bye for now. 

 JEFF BEZOS:  Thank you, you guys. 

 OPERATOR:  This concludes today's Amazon.com Q2 2002 financial results conference call.  You may now disconnect.

 PRESENTATION SUMMARY 

 A. Operational Review (JB)   1. Excited about 2Q02 results.   2. Saw book unit growth of 20% YoverY growth, up from 15% in past      four quarters.   3. Music sales challenging as for everyone, but books helped offset      this.   4. Saw improvements in electronics, tools and kitchen (ETK)      revenues. Electronics selection expanded 40% YoverY. 5. International business continues to execute with trailing 12 month revenues of $845m and revenue growth exceeding 70%.   6. Topline improvements good, bottom line even better.   7. Third consecutive data point in which lowering prices is working      for company.   8. Last July, after nearly two years focusing exclusively on cost structure, decided company could afford to balance growth and      cost improvement.   9. Increased discount on books over $20 to 30%. In January,      introduced year round free shipping option on orders over $99.      In April, lowered threshhold for 30% discount to $15. A month ago, introduced long-term test lowering threshhold for free super-saver shipping to $49.   10. Also sharpened prices in 1H02, particularly electronics and      DVDs.   11. Lowering price, driving selection and convenience are pillars      of strategy.   12. In last three quarters, sales growth accelerated as expected      from pricing actions. But operating margins also improved at a      rapid pace, reaching 3.2% of sales in 2Q02, an increase of over      740 basis points YoverY.   13. On trailing 12-month basis, pro forma operating profit was      $82m, 2.4% of sales, improvement of over $285m YoverY. 14. Even with lower book prices, sharpened pricing in many stores and free super-saver shipping, saw significantly improved      operating results.   15. Books, music and video (BMV) operating profit increased 26% to      12% operating margin, an increase of 150 basis points from 1Q02      on seasonally lower sales.   16. ETK sales continued to re-accelerate from 8% growth in 1Q02 to      16% in 2Q02. ETK segment losses improved 55%.   17. Customers see company as choice for media and also ETK.   18. Price reductions good tool for customers, but can be expensive      for company in short-term. Expect super-saver shipping initiative to have negative effect on 3Q02 margins.   19. See rewards of relentlessly lowering price, when it is      affordable to company, to be enormous as volume increases flow      across fixed cost structure. Productivity focus aids this      strategy.   20. 2Q02 pro forma operating expense decreased 7% on a 21% increase      in revenues.   21. Pro forma expense was 10.6% of sales, 220 basis points better      than prior year.   22. Improved variable cost productivity while driving convenience      for customers by eliminating mistakes and errors. Saw 50%      reduction in controllable defects. Worldwide units shipped per      labor hour improved 22% YoverY and customer service contacts per      order declined 30%.   23. Inventory turns increased to 19 on trailing 12-month basis, up      35% YoverY.   24. High number of turns reduces liquidations and improves capital      velocity.   25. Significant improvement in technology expense, 7.2% of sales in 2Q02, decline of 250 basis points from prior year period, driven      by several factors including move to more efficient hardware platform.   26. Improvements in variable cost productivity gives opportunity to      show operating leverage. In foreseeable future, believe company      can hold fixed costs while driving profitable volume increases      across base.   27. Result is fixed cost profitability that drops to the bottom      line and becomes available for further price reductions.   28. Believe can drive fixed and variable productivity for years to      come.   29. Third party business includes Marketplace and merchant      partners.   30. Two years ago, launched third party business with toysrus.com.      As part of single-store strategy, then offered customers      opportunity to shop for used products alongside new ones.   31. Momentum of third party sellers has since taken off with third      party sellers like Target and Circuit City, adding apparel,      electronics and other selections to product detail pages.   32. Success of initiative shown by company's 30m Web site visitors      a month. In 2Q02, 20% of US units, representing 35% of all US      orders, were purchased through third party sellers. Many of      these were customers who had not previously bought from company.   33. Over 40% of people purchasing from company bought from third      party sellers.   34. Marketplace business in Germany and UK growing twice as fast as      US Marketplace business four months after its launch.   35. Made decision to begin expensing stock options and other      stock-based award starting in FY03.   36. Opens door to more carefully crafted equity incentives.   37. For example, today strike prices must be set on date of grant.      In volatile stock market, employees  starting just days apart      can have dramatically different strike prices. More rational      system would set strike price at average price over 30-day      period from start of employment. But approach would require      expensing of stock options.   38. Expensing opens door to thinking about ideas such as restricted      stock and indexed options that might better align employees' and shareholders' interests.   39. Employee ownership is a founding tenet of company and major      reason for its success. Commitment will not change. 

 B. Operational Review By Segment (MP)   1. Revenues growth for 2Q02 exceeded 20% for second consecutive      quarter, reaching $806m.   2. Pro forma operating profit was $26m, 3.2% of sales, in 2Q02. For trailing 12-months, operating profit was $82m or 2.4% of sales.   3. Pro forma net loss, including interest expense, was $4m or $0.01      per share in 2Q02, vs. loss of $0.16 per share in 2Q01.   4. Free cash flow was $16m on a trailing 12-month basis, up $285m      YoverY.   5. Adjusted free cash flow, which is reduced for capital lease payments, was essentially breakeven on trailing 12-month basis.   6. Common stock outstanding was 380m shares on 6/30/2002,  up 5%      from prior year. Half of increase was result of $100m investment      by AOL about one year ago.   7. Trailing 12-month inventory turns were 19, an increase of 35%.   8. Third party business a success.   9. Productivity loop works, giving flexibility to lower prices and      invest in new product offerings like Marketplace and amazon.ca,      our Canadian website, while continuing to improve financial      performance.   10. Recognize there is still much to do.   11. Will seek improvements to customer experience, drive cost      productivity and increase demand with compelling value      proposition.   12. 2Q02 revenues were $806m, up 21% from prior year.   13. Active customers, those purchasing in the last 12 months,      totalled 27m, up 30% YoverY.   14. Gross profit increased $38m, or 21%, to $218m.   15. Gross margin was 27.1%, up 16 basis points. Improvements      primarily result of Marketplace sales, procurement improvements      and transportation-related savings, partially offset by      super-saver shipping and other price reductions.   16. As result of inbound freight savings and shipment injections,      covered cost of lost revenues from $99 super-saver shipping      offer, allowing migration to current $49 level.   17. Revenues in books, music and video grew 6% to $412m.   18. Books unit growth was 20%, offset by industry trend of slow      growth in music business.   19. Despite significant price reduction and lost shipping revenues,      gross profit rose 12% while gross margin reached 30%, an all-time high.   20. Pro forma operating profit in segment was $49m, up 26% YoverY,      while operating margins increased to record 12% of sales.   21. On trailing 12-month basis, operating margins for the segment      reached 11%, up 300 basis points YoverY.   22. In June, VirginMega.com launched as co-brand with BMV store      powered by company platform. Later this year, Virgin will      relaunch Japan Web site, powered by amazon.co.jp.   23. Launched Canadian Web site, amazon.ca. Partnered with Canadian      company on fulfillment services, launched in capital efficient      manner. Canadian customers will receive shipping incentives.   24. ETK revenues were up 16% to $128m. 25. Gross profit for segment was up 41%, gross margin rose over 240 basis points to 14%.   26. ETK segment loss declined 55% to $18m or 14% of sales, vs 37% a      year ago.   27. During quarter, became Sony reseller for cameras, camcorders,      handhelds, computers and monitors. Opened electronics      relationships with Yamaha, Toshiba and Microsoft.   28. Selection has increased 40% to more than 60,000 items since      12/31/01.   29. International segment revenues reached $218m, third consecutive      quarter of 70% or better YoverY increases.   30. Gross profit was $47m, up $18m or 61%.   31. International pro forma operating loss declined 66% to $10m, an      improvement of $20m vs. prior year.   32. YoverY impact of exchange rates on international segment      revenues was less than $100,000.   33. Optimistic about segment.   34. Sellers and customers enthusiastic about Marketplace offerings      in UK and Germany.   35. Delivery options such as cash on delivery in Japan and      invoicing in Germany attracting new customers.   36. In Japan, surpassed 1m active customer accounts in quarter.   37. Including exports, international revenues represented 34% of      company sales, up from 28% a year ago.   38. Services revenues increased $8m, or 22%, to $47m   39. Gross margin in segment was 61%, down from 68% a year ago.      Expect continued decline in margins over the year as fixed fee      advertising from 1999 represent lower percentage of overall      revenue mix.   40. Operating profit in segment was $6m, up 29% from prior year.   41. Started providing shopping functionality for AOL customers  as      of last week.   42. Will launch target.com, powered by amazon.com, in next several months and expand selection of Target products at company's Web site. 

 C. Financial Review (MP)   1. Fulfillment costs were $86m, 10.6% of sales, down 220 basis      points from 12.8% a year ago.   2. Marketing was $29m, a decline of 17% due mainly to more      efficient advertising and reductions in rates paid for traffic      generation.   3. Pro forma operating profit was $26m vs. a loss of $28m in 2Q01,      a $54m improvement.   4. 2Q02 was third consecutive quarter of operating profit.   5. Operating margin improved 740 basis points to 3%.   6. Pro forma net loss, including interest expense, was $4m, or      $0.01 per share, compared to loss of $0.16 per share in 2Q01.   7. GAAP net loss was $94m, or $0.25 per share, compared to 2Q01      loss of $168m or $0.47 per share.   8. Consider in GAAP results, each quarter company marks      euro-denominated debt to market, which resulted in a charge of      $71m in 2Q02. Also took $23m expense for stock-based compensation, due to upward movement in share price.   9. Cash flow was $48m on trailing 12-month basis, up more than      $200m, while free cash flow was $16m on trailing 12-month basis,      up $285m YoverY. 10. Asset efficiency: Ending inventory of $127m was lowest since 1999, while ability to serve customers with in-stock selection continues to improve.   11. Inventory turns were 19 on trailing 12-month basis, compares      favorably to other retailers.   12. On June 20, prepaid and other current assets increased about      $20m because a credit card service provider unintentionally      failed to make a scheduled payment.   13. Net investment in fixed assets was $220m, down 15% from year      ago.   14. Ended quarter with cash and marketable securities of about      $824m.   15. Had $43m in proceeds from employee stock options which were      excluded from operating and free cash flow calculation. 

 D. Guidance (MP)   1. 3Q02 guidance based on conservative assumptions.   2. It is not possible to accurately predict demand. Results could      differ materially.   3. Focus remains on long-term growth in free cash flow.   4. Expect 3Q02 net sales of $780-830m.   5. Expect 3Q02 pro forma operating profit between $8m and $17m.   6. Remember for 2Q02 comparison purposes that $49 super-saving shipping ran only last two weeks of quarter.   7. Expect net sales to grow 18% for FY02.   8. Expect to have pro forma net income, cover interest expense.   9. Expect $50m in cap ex spending.   10. Expect to generate free cash flow for the year.   11. Cannot provide guidance on GAAP net income. Option-based      compensation results in charge for any movement of stock price      in between reporting dates.   12. Intend to expense stock options and other stock compensation no later than January 2003. Will impact accounting for equity      awards granted after that time.   13. Company marks euro-denominated debt to market each quarter,      result is either non-cash gain or loss.   14. Cannot forecast these items, but they could have significant      impact positively or negatively on operating results.   15. Will continue to strive to put customer experience first.   16. Enter 2H02 with momentum, and pleased to have increased      guidance for balance of FY02.   17. Reaping benefits of scale.   18. Objective of company is to deliver for both customers and      shareowners. 

 QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY 

 Q1. (Sean (phonetic) Millney (phonetic), Soundview Technologies)  Your used products business had a big quarter, trading topline for  margin improvements. Will it grow as percentage of BMV in the next  couple quarters or top out at this level? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  That business grew very rapidly this quarter. We'd love to see  retail grow that fast. We're driving for unit growth and we don't  really care if it's Marketplace or owned inventory. It's priced so  that we are indifferent to that. I do expect it to continue. Outside  the US, our early experience indicates same kind of success is happening there. 

 Q2. (Jitel (phonetic) Patel, DeustcheBank Securities)  Have you thought about the timing of opening the technology platform  to a broad class of sellers? From a technology standpoint, are you  ready to handle that? Is there a time frame for that? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  We've been working now for almost three years building the various  tools sellers use on our platform. We did a huge buildout for  target.com launch over the last nine months or so. On our list of  projects to do, there are many that will do what you're talking  about, upgrade the platform for parties of all kinds to sell, alongside the detail  pages where the 30m visitors come. And that's just the US number, the worldwide number is much larger. We're not there yet. We've made huge progress over the last couple years. There's still huge progress to come. It works today, it can be  better. We know what we have to do and we have great people working  on it. 

 Q3. (Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley)  Color on unit growth across business lines? Do you have any customer  growth objectives? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  We only give unit growth for books. We don't want to make a practice  of giving out unit growth figures elsewhere. On cost growth, we  expect it to grow. We also expect customer growth to continue. We  also aren't giving guidance on line items like customer growth. 

 Q4. (Anthony Notto (phonetic), Goldman Sachs)  Can you walk through customer behavior in three phases, the intital  shipping offer, before and after, and then moving to the $49 hurdle  rate? Penetration growth and order size? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  We're only a few weeks into the super-saver program. We need three  to six months to assess the results. We have to be cautious about  early results. We know these kinds of offers take time for word to  spread. It is way early to comment. For color, we see it has  impacted certain categories more than others. We're studying that as  we consider next steps. 

 Q5. (Anthony Notto (phonetic), Goldman Sachs)  Philosophically you've debated growth vs. profitability, now  balancing both. In 2Q02, you came in above high end of revenues  expectations with record gross margins, then at quarter-end launched  a free shipping initiative that says you want to spend back on  growth. In 3Q02 you're forecasting a record growth rate, highest  since 4Q00. Will you continue to spend back on growth? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  Internally we have certain minimum unit growth rates we want to  generate. We are constrained by being able to afford to do so. One  of the most effective ways to hit unit growth targets is by using  price as a lever, whether in product or shipping. For each product  category, we have unit growth rate targets and we adjust our business to meet those rates. We have a hard constraint on the  minimum free cash flow we will accept over time and we balance  those. 

 Q6. (Anthony Notto (phonetic), Goldman Sachs)  So it it fair to say philosophically, in your revenues guidance  range, you're not going to manage above that range? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  Your question seems to suggest we have very short-term control over  revenues to bottom line tradeoff. I would not think about our  business that way. So we do the $49 super saver offer in the last  two weeks, that was not designed to increase revenues in the  quarter. It just happened to be the time to do it. It generally takes time for elasticity result to creep into the price decision. These aren't fine-tunable, not measured in weeks, but in months and quarters. 

 Q7. (Marcus (phonetic) Rowland (phonetic), Prudential Securities)  You had a full quarter of lowering book discounts to 30% off books  $15 and above. Do you have a sense of the elasticity? Is there more  room to go? Is $15 the bottom end of elasticity, or can you go to,  say, $10? How does that apply to the super-saver shipping? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  There is certainly elasticity if you took that to $10 or $5 or zero,  you would see elasticity there. The problem is you run the risk of  making those units unprofitable on a per unit basis. It costs the  same to handle a $7 paperback as a $30 hardback. There are more  gross profit dollars on an expensive item. The elasticity would be  there but it would not be profitable. Customers would buy more and you're not making money. 

 Q8. (Anthony Notto (phonetic), Goldman Sachs)  So that's getting to the bottom end of the range in terms of gross  profits and margins? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  I suspect $15 is around the right level. Whether it can come down  some, I wouldn't want to comment on that right now. Zero is too far. 

 Q9. (Anthony Notto (phonetic), Goldman Sachs)  And on the elasticity of the $49 freight hurdle? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  Too early to know what kind of offsetting volume we will get. We  will continue experiment, see what we learn in next two to five  months. In the first few weeks of the quarter, it's very early, but  we are continuing to see good books unit growth. 

 Q10. (Justin (phonetic) (indiscernible), Merrill Lynch)  Can you comment on the competitive environment, other e-tailers and  retailers? Can you gauge the impact of any competitive moves? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  We definitely consider ourselves leaders in this space. We're  proactive about our pricing agenda, better than anyone out there. We  understand it very well and get results much faster than anybody  else. We think we know a lot about setting prices where we think  they should be set. In the first few weeks of new quarter, though  early, we are pleased with continued book unit growth. 

 Q11. (Jeff Feeler, Bear Stearns)  If you had expensed stock options this quarter, do you know what the  impact would have been? 

 A. (Mark Peet (phonetic))  No. We do expense options from the exchange offer we made in 1Q01.  We're looking at different ways to offer equity instruments. We  can't estimate the impact. 

 Q12. (Jeff Feeler, Bear Stearns)  If you had expensed stock options this quarter, do you know what the  impact would have been? 

 A. (Jeff Bezos)  Except to say it will be negative. 

 Q13. (Jeff Feeler, Bear Stearns)  If you had expensed stock options this quarter, do you know what the  impact would have been? 

 A. (Mark Peet (phonetic))  Definitely, it will be negative.
